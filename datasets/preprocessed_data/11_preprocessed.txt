abstract
along with recent networking advances such as softwaredefined
networks network functions virtualization and programmable
data planes the networking field in a bid to construct highly op
timized selfdriving and selforganizing networks is increasingly
embracing artificial intelligence and machine learning it is worth
remembering that the modern internet that interconnects millions
of networks is a complex adaptive social system in which interven
tions not only cause effects but the effects have further knockon
consequences not all of which are desirable or anticipated we be
lieve that selfdriving networks will likely raise new unanticipated
challenges particularly in the humanfacing domains of ethics
privacy and security in this paper we propose the use of insights
and tools from the field of systems thinkinga rich discipline
developing for more than half a century which encompasses more
realistic models of complex social systemsand highlight their rel
evance for studying the longterm effects of network architectural
interventions particularly for selfdriving networks we show that
these tools complement existing simulation and modeling tools and
provide new insights and capabilities to the best of our knowledge
this is the first study that has considered the relevance of formal
systems thinking tools for the analysis of selfdriving networks

in equipping networks with autonomous runtime decisionmaking
capability through the incorporation of artificial intelligence ai
machine learning ml big data network analytics and network
telemetry to allow networks to configure manage and heal them
selves the idea that networks should learn to drive themselves is
gaining traction and there is a lot of interest in the networking com
munity to develop selfdriving networks  the idea itself is not
entirely new and reflects a recurring motif seen in various guises
such as cognitive networking  selforganized networks 
knowledge defined networks  and most recently datadriven
networking  and selfdriving networks  
the vision of selfdriving networks is promising and finds much
encouragement from recent advances in ml such as deep learning
and networking such as softwaredefined networks programmable
data planes and edge computing however there are many chal
lenges that remain most notably modern networks and their in
tegration into the global internet yields a complex adaptive social
system that encompasses the interaction of a vast diversity of au
tonomous devices human users applications and service providers
complex adaptive systems are characterized by their dynamic com
plexity and nonlinearity due to which the act of playing the game
has a way of changing the rules  any selfdriving network
must acknowledge and address this complexity hence the real
concern is not to only see the potential benefits of the approach to
the optimizing entity itself but to also critically understand poten
tial downsides and unintended consequences on other subsystems
in this work we seek to investigate the pros and cons of selfdriving
networks using systems thinking techniques
what is systems thinking
although many different definitions of systems thinking have been
proposed  all of them share an emphasis on interconnected
ness and interdependency they focus on understanding how vari
ous system entities influence each other and in turn themselves
through feedback loops the goal is to facilitate users in seeing
the proverbial forest for the trees  systems thinking is char
acterized by three important features firstly the ability to think
dynamically secondly to think causally through feedback loops
thirdly to think more deeply about endogenous influences where
the system itself is the cause of the observed problems  sys
tems thinking is different from conventional thinking in many ways
see table  but most prominently in modeling complex systems
nonlinear closedlooped and multicausal with delayed feedback
rather than linear openlooped causal with immediate feedback
systems thinking has made a big impact in research on complex
adaptive systems in such systems researchers have noted that

how to resolve problems

hardly anything is influenced linearly in just one direction and the
presence of multiple intertwined nonlinear feedback loops have
made social systems notorious for being counterintuitive  in
terms of selfdriving networks this implies that it is not sufficient
to optimize only a protocol an architecture or a network without
reasoning about how this will influence the other parts technical as
well as sociocultural aspects of the larger internet system systems
thinking the right tool for understanding complex adaptive social
systems since it is considered axiom in systems thinking that every
influence is both a cause and an effect   and that interactions
between subsystems are modeled by circular loops rather than
directed arrows
we can define a system as an interconnected set of elements
that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something  a
definition given by donella meadows a highly influential system
thinker and the lead author of the bestselling limits to growth
 the something in the definition may however be quite dif
ferent from what the designer intended if we find some stubborn
problems with a system that refuse to go away despite efforts and
best intentions some authors call these wicked problems  it is
likely that these problems are systemic ie the problems follow
from how the system is built and from its architectural choices
goals and constraints systems thinking opens us up to the fact
that wicked problems may not be resolvable through further in
terventions and that using more advanced technology is not always
good or neutral  thus systems thinking may be defined as
the ability to understand the systemic interconnections in such a way
as to achieve a desired purpose  for more information about
systems thinking we refer to various primers  and books
  on this topic
contributions of this paper
in this paper we aim to highlight that the internet and selfdriving
networks should be envisioned as complex adaptive systems in
which we should be wary of easy solutions and quick fixes as
pointed out by h l mencken theres always an easy solution to
every problem that is neat plausible but wrong in a similar vein
systems thinking research informs us that most wellintentioned
solutions fail to sustainably solve their addressed problems and
may actually create more problems than they solve however not
all solutions are doomed in this mannersome highleverage
solutions exist that can provide sustainable longrun benefits with
minimum effort and these can be uncovered by systems thinking
we propose the use of tools and insights from systems thinking in
selfdriving networks for managing the unintended consequences
of policies and for devising highleverage effective solutions to
the best of our knowledge this is the first proposal to use systems
thinking insights and tools for the study of selfdriving networks
and possibly also for the internet
why use systems thinking for
selfdriving networks
leveraging a rich set of theory and tools
systems thinking has been successfully used as a management tool
to study policymaking in domains such as healthcare education
management  and looks promising for selfdriving networks as
well the field of systems science is a highlydeveloped discipline
with many schools of thought including system dynamics com
plexity theory general systems theory human system dynamics
   we can leverage tools from a vast library of qualita
tive as well as quantitative tools eg visualisations domain specific
languages developed by the systems thinking community which
has been active since its genesis at mit in the s  
as an example of a qualitative system thinking tool consider
causal loop diagram cld which is an aid to visualize and easily
communicate how different system entities connect to each other
and influence each other possibly with a delay through reinforcing
positive or balancing negative feedback loops this could be
used to capture various aspects of decision making within modern
networks for instance content delivery networks cdns exert
significant influence on the traffic generated within isps by dynam
ically setting the destinations of a large fraction of flows this has
longterm impacts on isp decision making as well as transient ef
fects on relevant content producers transit providers and exchange
points it has been hypothesized that integrating the control loops
of these parties could have significant mutual benefits  self
driving networks offers a means to attain this but a vital precursor
would be formalizing the influences and dependencies between
these stakeholders clds offer a perfect tool
in contrast to clds the stock and flow diagram is a quantitative
system thinking tool for understanding systemic structure stocks
or accumulators are things that accumulate and can be measured
eg population bits transferred energy spent while flows or
rates represents things that change over time eg transmission
rate unlike clds stock and flow diagrams can provide informa
tion about rates of change due to the lack of space we limit our
discussion to these two tools only but highlight that the field has a
number of other tools details of which can be seen in  
support for rigorous big picture thinking
systems thinking also affords us the ability to see the big picture by
expanding our time and thought horizons using system thinking
tools we can take better policy decisions regarding selfdriving
networks and avoid an exclusive reliance on implicit mental mod
els which are illsuited for this task since they are simplistic since
they inadvertently substitute a higherorder nonlinear system for a
in this paper we consider systems thinking to be synonymous with system dynamics
 and to encompass it  although not everyone agrees

linear causal one narrow ie not broad enough to see the big pic
ture and myopic since they tend to discount the future and focus
predominantly on the shortterm  systems thinking can also
be used to better understand the connections between the various
subsystems in particular it helps us identify nonobvious connec
tions between effects and causes and also find missing connections
which if they had existed would have improved the system perfor
mance of our selfdriving networks
finding highleverage interventions
in systems thinking systems respond to interventions according to
the principle of leverage  previous research in system dynam
ics has shown that most intuitively obvious policy interventions
in complex social systems are lowleverage ie they do not pro
duce significant longrun change and will likely also create other
problems and only a few policy interventions are highleverage
ie capable of producing substantial longrun change system
dynamics research has consistently highlighted the counterintu
itive nature of complex social systems in that the highleverage
points are not where most people expect and if even these points
are identified they are prone to be altered in the wrong direction
by people  in an influential essay on leverage  donella
meadows stated that interventions that rely only on parameter
optimization are typically low leverage and higher leverage can be
attained through deeper interventions that for example optimize
information flows eg by minimizing information sharing delays
or change the system rules ie the incentives and the constraints
the most powerful way to change a system meadows notes is to
change the system goals and paradigm out of which its goals rules
and culture emerge although these ideas are abstract we can use
insights about leverage points to unearth the few sensitive influ
ence points in selfdriving networks thereby avoiding some of the
problems that have plagued traditional networks
facilitating systemascause thinking
in systems thinking it is considered an axiom that every influence
is both a cause and an effectie it is possible that when a causes b
b also causes a through a feedback loopin such doubly looped sys
tem the systems are said to cause their own behavior endogenously
we can use the systems thinking concept of systemasacause to
explain how the perennial internet nuisances such as spam and
lack of privacy security and qos are not isolated problems but
as noted by keshav  follow endogenously as the byproducts of
the internets design p
