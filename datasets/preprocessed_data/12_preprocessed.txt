abstract
cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data can support
numerous applications in and beyond networking however op
erators are very reluctant to share their data which is curbing
innovation and research reproducibility to remedy this status quo
we propose spectragan a novel deep generative model that upon
training with realworld network traffic measurements can produce
highfidelity synthetic mobile traffic data for new arbitrary sized
geographical regions over long periods to this end the model only
requires publicly available context information about the target
region such as population census data spectragan is an original
conditional gan design with the defining feature of generating
spectra of mobile traffic at all locations of the target region based on
their contextual features evaluations with mobile traffic measure
ment datasets collected by different operators in  cities across two
european countries demonstrate that spectragan can synthesize
more dependable traffic than a range of representative baselines
from the literature we also show that synthetic data generated
with spectragan yield similar results to that with real data when
used in applications like radio access network infrastructure power
savings and resource allocation or dynamic population mapping

introduction
datadriven analysis and optimization enable rich insights to design
efficient automated systems and to create new valueadded services
and the availability of large datasets is a key contributor to these
developments   in the networking context spatiotemporal
mobile traffic is arguably a highly valuable form of data it consists
of information about the timevarying traffic load observed at all
locations in a target geographical region a data sample is illustrated
in figure  plot a shows the time averaged spatial distribution
of mobile traffic across a city whereas plot c portrays the space
averaged temporal fluctuations of the same traffic over one week
additional time series in plot c highlight the diversity of traffic
volumes and patterns at different locations
information on cityscale mobile traffic has numerous appli
cations within and beyond networking prominent examples of
network problems that benefit from mobile traffic data include
resource management      mobile network infrastruc
ture planning  network energy efficiency optimization  
or network monitoring  beyond networking usages for spa
tiotemporal mobile traffic emerge eg in urban sensing and com
puting    inference of commuting patterns and segrega
tion     monitoring of demographic patterns  
   detection of land use and its dynamics  transporta
tion engineering and urban planning  or road traffic surveil
lance  
limited access to mobile traffic data all aforementioned ap
plications are enabled by mobile traffic data that is inherently de
personalized as shown in figure  the data is aggregated over space
eg across all users associated to a same base station or within
a same spatial area and time eg during intervals of minutes to
hours although its nature poses reduced privacy risks eg as
corroborated by the european unions general data protection
regulation spatiotemporal mobile traffic data is deemed sensitive
by network operators in terms of industrial and commercial se
crecy hence access to this data is not uniform and generally scant
in the research community and often occurs behind restrictive non
disclosure agreements ndas the result is that ùëñ the potential
of mobile traffic data to feed innovation is curbed and ùëñùëñ current
research based on mobile traffic is not reproducible or verifiable
synthesis as a solution to data access motivated by the above
and to overcome the mobile traffic data access barrier we aim at
generating dependable synthetic cityscale spatiotemporal mobile
traffic data our goal is to design a model trained on a limited
amount of realworld measurement data which can then be used
to generate large amounts of highfidelity synthetic traffic from
publicly available data about arbitrary geographical regions
such a model primarily benefits researchers but also data holders
such as network operators by using the trained model researchers

would be finally able to independently generate dependable mobile
traffic data to support their studies ideally this could lead to the
adoption of a reference ensemble of synthetic datasets of spatiotem
poral mobile traffic by the community ensuring the comparability
of results across works based on such type of data in addition data
holders can leverage the model to synthesize and share realistic mo
bile traffic data from their measurements with third parties without
concerns on leakage of commercially sensitive information
challenges of mobile traffic generation however meeting
the goal above entails a number of significant and unique challenges
firstly generation requires synthesizing spatiotemporal data like
that in figure  without prior knowledge of the historical traffic
in the target area it is thus a different and more complex problem
than eg mobile traffic prediction secondly ours is a controllable
generation problem the model is required to capture nontrivial
correlations between the urban context and the corresponding mo
bile traffic so as to generate traffic for a previously unseen urban
region solely based on its local contextual conditions thirdly as
cities have diverse geographical span the model should be capable
of generating traffic over arbitrary spatial dimensions fourthly
mobile traffic information must cover long time periods to be useful
in many applications therefore the model should allow generating
traffic time series of any specified and potentially long duration
without compromising dependability meeting these last two re
quirements entails capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics
seen in realworld mobile traffic    so as to preserve eg
traffic peaks and flows across space and time that are rooted in
mobile user movements and digital usages
our contributions to attain the goal outlined above and ad
dress the associated challenges we propose spectragan a novel
generative model based on a tailored deep neural network architec
ture in essence spectragan is a conditional neural sampler with
two main components an encoder and a generator the role of the
encoder is to transform contextual information that is readily avail
able via public repositories broadly falling into three categories
ie census land use and points of interest pois so that it can be
used to control of the generation process an example of context
used by our approach is the inhabitant density from population
census portrayed in figure b for the same city of figure a
the generator receives the hidden representation of the context
produced by the encoder and outputs spatiotemporal synthetic traf
fic to this end it leverages the insight that mobile traffic at any
given location exhibits repeating variations over time as observed
in the literature    and in figure c this manifests in the
form of small number of dominant components when traffic is
viewed in the frequency domain as illustrated in figure d our
generator directly generates the significant frequency components
based on the input context then turns them into a time series via an
inverse fourier transform as shown in figure e this already well
approximates the actual traffic variations finally the generator
adds a separately produced contextdriven residual temporal signal
to model smaller fluctuations in traffic as in figure f the pro
cess above is run concurrently and independently on small spatial
patches which are then sewed together to obtain traffic data over
the whole target region spectragan is adversarially trained √† la

 we introduce spectragan a novel conditional gan model that
leverages a frequency representation of localized traffic to gener
ate mobile traffic for any desired region and temporal duration
given the relevant contextual data  this is the first solution to
the important and hard problem of synthesizing spatiotemporal
mobile traffic from only publicly available information 
 we evaluate spectragan with multicity mobile traffic mea
surement datasets collected in two european countries  our
results not only justify the design choices for the different com
ponents of spectragan but also show its superior ability in
generating highfidelity longterm traffic for previously unseen
cities relative to representative baseline approaches 
 we further evaluate spectragan with practical use cases in
networking and beyond and show that using synthetic traffic
data generated with our model yields results comparable to those
obtained with real traffic data 
upon publication of this work we will make a synthetic spatiotem
poral mobile traffic dataset generated using spectragan available

to the research community specifically this dataset will consist of
traffic data for five diverse sized cities in germany obtained with
context data for those cities retrieved from public sources as input
to a pretrained spectragan model
spectragan
we first formalize the problem of synthesizing cityscale spatiotem
poral mobile traffic data then outline our spectragan approach
before presenting the detailed design of its generative model
overview
we start by elaborating on the requirements and challenges that
the target model needs to meet and address
requirements and challenges
generation versus prediction note that traffic generation
task is different from traffic prediction the latter is an active re
search direction in the context of mobile traffic on its own see
eg    given a sequence of citylevel traffic data snap
shots x     xùëáover ùëátimesteps and the corresponding context
information c eg population pois as input training data the
goal of generation is to model the joint conditional probability
ùëùx     xùëá c whereas the goal of prediction is to model the con
ditional probability ùëùxùë° xùë° c while seemingly similar the
former is relatively a much harder task as the distribution is more
complex as apparent when factorizing the joint distribution as
ùëùx     xùëá c  ùëùx  cùëùx  x c    ùëùxùëá x     xùëá c
compared to ùëùxùë° xùë° c the joint modeling requires to estimate
multiple such conditional probabilities and an extra term ùëùx  c
which is complex as it is in other words while the prediction in
volves only estimating the local changes from ùë° to ùë° generation
demands synthesizing the first point x for a given context c and
also estimating multiple consecutive changes towards xùëá
controllability an ideal generation method should let users
modify the output synthetic data by specifying certain properties
of the target urban region as context input such as cartography
of urbanization levels and layout of the different city infrastruc
tures such a controllable generation calls for conditional generative
models rather than just the more common freeform generation
approaches such as those based on vanilla generative adversarial
networks gans
modeling arbitrary spatial sizes in order to work with dif
ferent cities the model should be able to condition generation on
context with arbitrary spatial size this is a known nontrivial task
in machine learning as popular multilayer perceptron mlp or
convolutional neural network cnn architectures only operate on
input with fixed dimensions recent works try to tackle the problem
in a principled way   yet no ultimate solution is available
modeling temporal correlations mobile network traffic ex
hibits a consistent longterm behavior that the generated data should
faithfully reproduce learning longterm correlations is challeng
ing for recurrent neural networks rnns where gradients tend
to either vanish or explode in the long term during training 
although we mention a onestep prediction with a firstorder markov property here
the argument can be generalized to any horizon and order
figure  traffic flow illustrated the peak traffic area shown
in the red circle shifts from one region to a neighboring re
gion over a hour period
while long shortterm memory lstm  can alleviate this is
sue solving it fully via a pure recurrent model requires additional
constraints on the model resulting in a higher complexity  
modeling spatiotemporal correlations mobile network traf
fic correlations are not only spatial and temporal but also spa
tiotemporal specifically mobile network traffic features significant
activity peaks that occur at different times in different locations
these traffic flows are due to the mobility and activity of users and
are illustrated in figure  where the traffic peak shifts from one
location to another nearby within a twohour period therefore the
spatial and temporal dimensions of the generation problem cannot
be addressed in isolation but complex spatiotemporal correlations
must be fully captured
problem statement the task of conditional spatiotemporal
mobile network traffic generation is to synthesize traffic data x con
ditioned on context c formally let us consider a city ùëöwhose geo
graphical surface is tessellated according to a regular spatial grid
we term each grid element a pixel and assume that ùëöis covered by
ùêªùëöùëäùëöpixels the cityscale traffic over ùëátimesteps denoted
as xùëö
ùëá xùëö
      xùëö
ùëá is a dimensional tensor in rùëáùêªùëöùëäùëö
the generation of xùëö
ùëáis conditioned on ie controlled by the
context for that city denoted as cùëörùê∂ùêªùëöùëäùëö where ùê∂is the
number of different types of contextual attributes note that cùëöis a
pure spatial context the conditional generation task is to draw
samples 
xùëö
ùëá for a given length of time ùëá from the conditional
distribution ùëùx     xùëá  cùëö
although the true conditional distribution for city ùëöis not
accessible we can leverage available data from other urban ar
eas accordingly we take a datadriven approach and design a
parametric probabilistic model with parameters ùúÉ representing
ùëùùúÉx     xùëá
 c and fit the model on training data in par
ticular given groundtruth traffic and context data for ùëÅcities
d  x
ùëá c     xùëÅ
ùëá cùëÅ we fit ùúÉon d by finding ùúÉthat
minimizes the divergence d between data distribution ùëùd and
model ùëùùúÉ ie ùúÉ arg minùúÉdùëùd ùëùùúÉ depending on the specific
training methods different divergence criteria d can be consid
ered once trained the model can draw samples based on city ùëö
context cùëöto synthesize 
xùëö
ùëá
implicit to this formulation is the assumption that the conditional
distribution ùëùx     xùëá c relating spatiotemporal traffic pat
terns with context information holds across the ùëÅcities employed
the contextual attributes we consider ie census land use pois vary over timescales
of months or years which are much longer than those of traffic variations in the
order of minutes in that sense the contextual attributes in our problem setting can be
viewed as static in time
conext  december   virtual event germany
kai xu et al
for training and the target city ùëöfor which mobile traffic needs to
be generated this assumption is key to the ability of the model
to generalize to unseen cities and is common to most conditional
generation tasks eg   we verify that the assumption holds
in our mobile traffic datasets through evaluations in  also note
that the above problem and our proposed model outlined below
are general enough that they can support arbitrary units and types
of mobile network traffic these are determined by the nature of
the training data which the synthetic data inherently mimics
outline of proposed solution at a high level our proposed
solution is to represent ùëùùúÉas a conditional neural sampler ie model
ùëùùúÉas a deep neural network specifically our conditional neural
sampler consists of two major components an encoder eg
ùúÉthat
processes c into a hidden representation and a generator gùúÉthat
takes the output of the encoder along with a noise vector z to
output samples 
xùëá we follow the common approach to train
such generative models in an adversarial manner following the
framework of generative adversarial networks gans  gans
essentially provide a practical way to match the data and model
distribution as per the jensenshannon divergence  and have
been found to be empirically successful for this purpose
our proposed design of ùëùùúÉis guided by the specific requirements
of spatiotemporal mobile traffic data generation as set out in 
specifically the neural network model we devise named spectra
gan takes the spatial context for a target city and noise as inputs
and directly outputs the frequency components of the signal rep
resenting traffic across the target city over time along with the
residual timeseries signal the rationale for this approach is best
explained by means of an example illustrated in figure  which
refers to the mobile traffic observed over one week in a represen
tative city from our dataset the temporal patterns in the mobile
network traffic in figure c stand out because of the regularity
in the underlying network usage reflecting weekdayweekend di
chotomies circadian rhythms and routines at work commuting or
other daily activities
such periodicities make a frequencydomain representation via
fourier transformation a compact yet effective way to capture
the usagedependent temporal dynamics indeed figure d which
shows the traffic timeseries data from each pixel in all cities of
our dataset in the frequency domain highlights how only a few
frequency components appear to be significant across the whole
dataset consistent with observations in prior work eg   
the effectiveness of a spectrum based design is further proven by
figure e which portrays the mean traffic reconstructed from the
 significant frequency components the overlap with the original
traffic confirms that the time variation in traffic can be well ap
proximated by considering the significant frequency components
the residual traffic in figure f shows the small part of difference
between original and generated traffic which is separately modeled
in spectragan in the time domain
in the light of these considerations a neural sampler that outputs
frequency components can be expected to be especially effective at
modeling mobile traffic dynamics moreover there are two impor
tant additional advantages with a spectrum based generation first
the approach lends itself to learning relation between context and
traffic data on a perpixel basis this allows capturing the differences
in significance of various frequency components at the pixel level
shown in orange in figure d second decomposing traffic into
periodic and nonperiodic parts and modeling the former in the
frequency domain and the latter in the temporal domain allows
overcoming the limitations of rnns mentioned earlier in 
indeed a spectrum representation naturally adds patterns with
identical periodicity in the same bin and enables a more effective
learning of traffic time series over long time periods the follow
ing subsection details the spectragan architecture while also
explaining how it addresses the other challenges from  such
as handling arbitrary spatial sizes
detailed design
input specification as directly working on data for arbi
trary city sizes poses challenges to neural network design instead
of modeling the entire city traffic map and its dynamics as a whole
our model operates on smaller sized fixed dimensional subregions
of the map which we call traffic patches for every time step specif
ically each traffic patch x has the spatial dimensions of ùêªùë° ùëäùë°
and each context patch c has the spatial dimensions of ùêªùëêùëäùëê we
specifically choose ùêªùëê ùêªùë°and ùëäùëê ùëäùë° as we experimentally
found that not only the context within the target patch but also that
surrounding the patch correlates with hence allows conditioning
its mobile traffic dynamics
generator as illustrated in figure a our conditional neu
ral sampler ùëùùúÉhas three components an encoder eg
ùúÉ a spectrum
generator gùë†
ùúÉand a timeseries generator gùë°
ùúÉ all of which operate
at the patch level
 eg
ùúÉ rùê∂ùêªùëêùëäùëêrùê∂‚Ñéùêª‚Ñéùëä‚Ñéis a cnn that takes the context
conditions c as input and and outputs a hidden representation
of the context h where ùê∂‚Ñéis the number of channels and ùêª‚Ñéùëä‚Ñé
are height and width of each channel

takes h and noise z as inputs and outputs the traffic in the fre
quency domain denoted as 
yùë† here ùëçis the dimension of the
noise vector z and ùêπis the dimension of frequency components
here 
yùë†is further passed to an inverse fourier transformation
to convert it to the time domain 
xùë† specifically the inverse fast
fourier transformation ifft note that ifft is differentiable
so is the overall generator making gradientbased optimization
possible
 gùë°
ùúÉ rùê∂‚Ñéùêª‚Ñéùëä‚Ñé rùëçùêª‚Ñéùëä‚Ñérùëáùêªùë°ùëäùë°is a batched lstm
it takes h and z as inputs and outputs the residual traffic in the
time domain 
xùë°
finally the outputs of two generators are summed to obtain the
generated traffic patch ie

training following standard gan formulations  we
train the model by minimizing the jensenshannon divergence ie
ùúÉ arg minùúÉjs ùëùd ùëùùúÉ and with the aid of discriminators as in
the gan framework we denote such discriminators as r due to
their role as density ratio estimators  specifically the corre

spatiotemporal mobile traffic data generation our goal is
to generate citylevel mobile traffic data of arbitrary length ùëá for
a target city given its context we now fill the gap between the
patched fixedlength training and this goal
traffic maps of variable spatial sizes at each timestep we out
put a set of patches that cover the whole city map and sew them
into a complete map generating a nonoverlapping set of patches

figure  example of multiple approximation
to make up the city map has the downside of leaving undesirable
artifacts at the edge of each patch so we instead take a sliding win
dow approach over space to generate partially overlapping patches
for each timestep as such each pixel in the target city map for a
timestep is generated multiple times as part of different patches
the final value of a pixel is taken as the average over all values

ùëù is the corresponding local index of the pixel in each
patch investigation of more sophisticated methods for aggregating
different estimates for each pixel beyond the average is left for
future work note that the above averaging step in spectragan
is very different from that in kriging  the core task in kriging
is spatial interpolation ie estimating the value of a pixel from its
neighbors for which there are measurement observations in con
trast we have multiple values generated for each pixel in different
patches where it is part of
in addition it is worth emphasizing that the randomness should
be shared across spatial dimension when generating patches oth
erwise the randomness together with the averaging operation in
equation  essentially outputs the expected traffic per pixel lead
ing to oversmoothed traffic maps so we use same noise vector
which models stochasticity and also represents unobserved context
attributes across all patches for the target city
traffic patch timeseries beyond the training length we can easily
generate arbitrary length signal using gùë°
ùúÉby recurrently running a
rnn for the desired number of timesteps within each patch do
ing the same is not as straightforward for gùë†
ùúÉ which outputs fixed
length frequency components these components are essentially a
discretization of the underlying continuous frequency distribution
the latter is needed to generate time series of any given length we
therefore perform an approximation in the frequency domain in
order to generate longer time series more concretely since the
duration of the time signal obtained via ifft is linearly propor
tional to the number of frequency components ùêπ we can act on the
latter to obtain a time series with target duration ùëá specifically
for a frequency vector f of length ùêπ we first expand f to a desired
length ùêπ  ùëá   if ùêπ is a ùëòmultiple of ùêπ our approximation
initializes the newly expanded vector f with zeroes and then fills
every ùëòùë°‚Ñélocation in this vector using values from the old one f
scaled by ùëòso that the total energy is ùëòtimes see figure  for
an example with ùëò  this procedure gives f with the desired
length ùêπ and ensures the total energy is also correctly multiplied
we omit the spatial index in this paragraph as it refers to a single patch
conext  december   virtual event germany
kai xu et al
this produces an approximation of the signal in the time domain
as ifftf ifftf where fis the ground truth discretized
frequency domain representation of the targeted length see ap
pendix c for a justification such a procedure can be more involved
if ùêπ is not a multiple of ùêπas it would require careful smoothing
to avoid potential aliasing with total energy preservation we do
not explore a general approximation in this paper as we are mainly
interested in outputting traffic for multiple weeks
evaluation methodology
we evaluate spectragan in  using a wide range of fidelity met
rics in comparison with multiple alternative baseline approaches
that reflect the state of the art in  we also evaluate the effec
tiveness of synthetic traffic data generated with spectragan to
support diverse application use cases in the rest of this section we
elaborate on the reference datasets metrics and baselines
reference datasets
in order to assess the performance of spectragan and baselines
we employ realworld mobile traffic data measured in the networks
of operators in two european countries we also gather a variety
of contextual data for the same regions from public sources
mobile traffic data as our interest is with the generation of
synthetic traffic at urban scale we focus on  major cities and
refer to them as city acity i  cities and city city  
cities in the two countries respectively the data was collected
by the operators using passive measurement probes deployed in
their infrastructure under the control of the local data protection
officers dpos and in compliance with applicable regulations the
data was aggregated in secure servers at the operators premises
and we only had access to the depersonalized aggregates
the aggregates report the total mobile data traffic generated
by the whole subscriber base of the operators in the target cities
which accounts for around  of the mobile user population in
both countries the data have a homogeneous format across all
cities as the traffic load is represented over a regular grid tessella
tion of space with each grid element ie pixel covering   
m in all cities the data covers a continuous period of  weeks with
a temporal granularity of  minutes these settings are aligned
with those of the most popular mobile traffic dataset that is cur

context data our conditional generation model takes advantage
of contextual attributes to produce credible synthetic traffic we
gather a wide range of context data from easily accessible open
sources so that the method is applicable as widely as possible all
attributes are mapped via spatial interpolation or counting to the

land use the different utilization of the territory in each grid

points of interest pois the number of landmarks of a spe
cific class within each grid element extracted from the open
streetmap osm repository  we filter out a large fraction of
insignificant poi categories using a correlation analysis with traffic
and retain  poi categories in table 
in summary we use  different context conditions a subset of
which are exemplified in figure  for one of the cities in our dataset
it is worth noting that no single attribute is strongly correlated
with the mobile traffic as shown in table  this suggests that a
naive univariate statistical model based on any attribute would not
be effective and motivates considering them together as we do in
spectragan as a final consideration we stress that additional
relevant context such as base station locations or radiofrequency
signal propagation maps is not considered since it is typically not
publicly available and difficult to access  which would impair our
intended design of relying solely on easily retrieved context
metrics
we use a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics to
assess fidelity of spectragan relative to the baselines qualita
tive metrics allow visual inspection of the generated data to check
its unacceptability hence complementing quantitative metrics
specifically we consider three forms of qualitative assessments ùëñ
spectragan
conext  december   virtual event germany
timeaveraged city traffic maps ùëñùëñ timeseries of average citywide
traffic and ùëñùëñùëñ traffic videos showing spatiotemporal variations
we also consider five different quantitative metrics outlined
below that cover a wide range of aspects of interest
marginal by total variation mtv this metric quantifies
how well the traffic distribution of generated data matches that of
the real data to compute it we first obtain the empirical marginal
distributions of traffic volume across all locations pixels and time
steps for both real and synthetic data then the metric is calculated
as the total variation tv distance  between the two marginal
distributions  lower the value of this metric better is the match
between real and synthetic data
ssim on average traffic ssim ssim  is a standard image
fidelity metric which compares two images as a function of their
respective mean and variance across pixels as well as covariance
between the images ssim lies between  and  closer to the latter
is desirable we use this metric to quantify the spatial fidelity of the
generated data by a model and compute it using the timeaveraged
traffic maps for real and synthetic data
autocorrelation by ùêø acùêø this metric also considered
in previous work  is aimed at quantifying the temporal fidelity
of the synthetic data with respect to the real data we compute it
by taking the ùêø norm between the corresponding points of the
autocorrelations of real and synthetic timeseries data at the pixel
level lower values imply better performance as per this metric
trainsynthetictestreal tstr this metric aims to capture
the quality of generated data through the lens of a generic down
stream use case as done in previous works  we use synthesized
citywide traffic timeseries to train a linear regression model to
predict city traffic snapshot for a future timestep the performance
of the trained model is then evaluated on real data in terms of ùëÖ
fr√©chet video distance fvd  this metric originally de
signed for video data aims at evaluating the quality of spatiotempo
ral data generation by treating cityscale mobile traffic over time
as video data we obtain embeddings of real and synthetic videos
and then compute the fr√©chet distance between these embeddings
 lower this distance better the quality in the video generation set
ting the embeddings are obtained via a pretrained neural network
however using a neural network in our case entails a risk to intro
duce a bias that may artificially favor our model instead we devise
a strategy tailored to our spatiotemporal mobile traffic generation
setting specifically we first spatially flatten the spatiotemporal
traffic data into a multivariate timeseries we then use a signature
transformation   to convert the multivariate timeseries into
a vector which we use as the embedding and employ vectors of
the real and synthetic traffic data to compute fvd
baselines
to evaluate spectragan we consider the following baselines that
represent the stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation as well
as generic spatial temporal and spatiotemporal data generation
fit distribution and sample fdas as later discussed in 
the current stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation essentially
involve fitting an empirical distribution to model the traffic data
using maximum likelihood estimation of parameters and then sam
ple it afterwards to generate synthetic data while previous works
focus on just the peak hour  or peak and offpeak hours 
a weekly traffic generated with fdas for city a averaged
across the city grey and at two locations with maximum
blue and median red traffic volume as per figure c
b city c
c city d
d city h
figure  qualitative results for fdas synthetic data
we fit a separate distribution to the fit the pixellevel traffic for
every hour of the day and sample from those different distributions
to generate citywide spatiotemporal mobile traffic data like in
 we find lognormal distribution best fits the data but with
different parameters across distributions as expected
pixpix from a spatial data generation perspective the pixpix
model  from the computer vision domain is a representative
prior work it uses a unet  based conditional gan architecture
for imagetoimage translation we adapt pixpix to mobile traffic
generation by conditioning it on spatial context attributes as in
spectragan note that pixpix does not have a notion of time
doppelganger  this is a stateoftheart work on con
ditional timeseries data generation and is based on an rnnbased
conditional gan architecture as doppelganger itself does not
have a spatial dimension we use an independent instance of dop
pelganger for each pixel conditioning it on the context attributes
corresponding to that pixel
convdlstm as a representative of the start of the art on
spatiotemporal data generation we use a conditional gan model
combining d convolution convd with convolutional lstm
convlstm  this combination is seen to be an effective choice
for spatiotemporal data generation in the literature   for tasks
like road traffic flows with convd capturing local spatial dynamics
and convlstm for longterm correlations to realize this model
for our mobile traffic generation task we use the same encoder as
in spectragan to transform the context data to an intermediate
representation that is then fed to the generator
in addition to the above baselines we also consider an ideal case
for reference which we refer to as data metrics for this case are
computed by comparing two distinct week periods of real data
against each other and as such is an approximation of the best
achievable values for the different quantitative metrics
evaluation results
in this section we first evaluate the fidelity and generalizability of
citywide spatiotemporal traffic data generated with spectragan
relative to baselines  then we examine the effect of design
choices underlying our approach through an ablation study
conext  december   virtual event germany
kai xu et al
overall generation quality
we first present the results considering country  dataset and
then for country  dataset note that the two datasets used are not
mixed in our evaluations rather they are explored in isolation since
they are collected by different operators in different countries
as we are concerned with cityscale spatiotemporal mobile traffic
data generation we adopt a leaveonecityout evaluation approach
essentially we choose one city as a test city each time and train
each model spectragan and baselines with traffic and associ
ated context data for the remaining cities and repeat this process
with a different test city for all cities we conduct this evaluation
separately for country  dataset with  cities and country 
dataset with  cities this not only allows us to study the relative
fidelity of different models with respect to the metrics described
in  but also lets us assess the generalization ability of different
models to synthesizing mobile traffic for unseen cities this testing
approach is also well aligned with the intended use of spectragan
to generate traffic data for new regions solely from publicly avail
able context for those regions finally it is worth recalling that the
considered cities have various sizes ranging from    to   
pixels therefore the leaveonecityout strategy allows assessing
the capability of the model to generate traffic for arbitrarily sized
areas since the dimension of the training cities and test city may
not be the same
unless otherwise specified in the following the traffic data is
generated at an hourly granularity to be consistent across all the
methods compared but we remark that spectragan is by de
sign potentially capable of generating more granular traffic data if
equivalently accurate data is available for training as we show later
in appendix b concerning the temporal duration of the synthetic
data all models are trained on week long data and then made
to generate data for weeks different from that in training data
this lets us evaluate the capability of different models to generate
data for a long period
country  we start with discussing the fidelity perfor
mance of fdas baseline recall that the fdas method relies on
sampling empirically fitted traffic data distributions at every time
step figure a shows citywide average temporal traffic pattern
generated by fdas for city a as test city data generated for two
representative pixels reflecting the maximum and median traffic
pixels in the ground truth are also shown the corresponding real
timeseries traffic pattern is shown in figure c the fdas gen
erated data fails to preserve the diurnal pattern seen in the real
data it is also unable to capture the absolute differences in traffic
volumes across different locations
we can make the same observation about spatial traffic patterns
with fdas the timeaveraged traffic maps for city c city d
and city h generated with fdas are respectively shown in fig
ures b c d which are in stark contrast to the corresponding
real traffic maps shown in figure  in the row labeled data the
seemingly random traffic timeseries and maps generated by fdas
can be attributed to the inherent limitation with this approach to
treat spatial locations and time steps independently thus unable
to capture strong correlations that exist across these dimensions
while we find that fdas can capture the overall citywide traffic
data distributions well as reflected by its mtv results not shown

data
and expected given its nature the spatiotemporal data generated
is clearly unacceptable from its qualitative results so we do not
consider this method further in our evaluations the above results
with fdas also support mobile traffic data generation via machine
learning models generally and deep generative models in particular
as we do with spectragan
we now consider the quality of generated data with the rest of
the methods including spectragan starting with a visual inspec
tion of the timeaveraged traffic map results in figure  for the
same subset of cities highlighted above we observe that spectra
gan shows a good match with real data in capturing the spatial
traffic patterns pixpix captures traffic hotspot areas well but also
shows a strong blur effect highlighting that the image generation
approach is not readily applicable for the mobile traffic generation
case calling for a tailored approach for the latter setting doppel
ganger shows clear artifacts due to independently generating
traffic timeseries per pixel without regard to correlations among
nearby pixels convdlstm tends to also generate traffic where
there should be none leading to unsatisfactory spatial quality
we now switch our attention to examine the temporal aspect
of generated data with the different methods here we only high
light the generated citywide traffic timeseries results for one city
city b in figure  for a week long period spectragan yields
temporal traffic pattern that is in close alignment with the real
data for the whole period figure a while pixpix as expected
completely fails to model any temporal aspects figure b the
traffic timeseries generated with both doppelganger figure c
and convdlstm figure d exhibit deviations from real data
to different degrees we discuss the potential root causes below
table  summarizes the fidelity performance of different methods
in terms of quantitative metrics when considering each city in
country  as a test city and averaging the resulting metric values
across all test cities here we mark the best worst performing
methods for each metric with green red colors we make the
following observations spectragan yields the best performance
in almost all metrics even for tstr it is almost similar to the best
performing method convdlstm and best possible data
case these results also demonstrate the generalization ability of
spectragan to new unseen cities pixpix performs the worst
among metrics involving temporal aspects hence also in the traffic
data distribution quantified by mtv but it does well on the
spatial fidelity metric ssim which is expected
both doppelganger and convdlstm yield intermedi
ate results with doppelganger performing particularly worse in
terms of spatial fidelity ssim metric the independent pixellevel
timeseries generation approach of doppelganger also limits its
we make the full set of results including the traffic videos generated with different
methods accessible via an anonymous repository at httpsbitlyptenk

ablation study
here we perform ablation study on some key components of spec
tragan to justify their choice
importance of rich contexts we study the importance of using
a wider context scope to generate each traffic pixel via comparing
spectragan to a variant with only pixellevel context as is the
case naturally for doppelganger when applied to spatiotemporal
data generation table  shows the average performance in terms
of quantitative metrics for country  dataset results show that
not conditioning on a wide context worsens performance on several
of the metrics with the effect more pronounced for spatial fidelity

wider context to condition spatiotemporal traffic generation
importance of spectrum generator we study the relevance of spec

all metrics especially reflected by the degraded fvd for all variants
the noticeably degraded performance of timeonly which is
essentially doppelganger with a wider context and explicit loss
in time domain in  of the  metrics highlights the benefit of our
hybrid spectratimeseries traffic generation
application use cases
to complement the previous evaluation we assess the utility of
spectragan through multiple downstream application use cases
for spatiotemporal mobile traffic specifically we employ synthetic
data generated by spectragan to feed models for ùëñ energy
efficient micro base station bs sleeping  and ùëñùëñ resource
allocation in virtualized rans vrans  we also demonstrate
the benefits of spectragan beyond mobile networking via ùëñùëñùëñ
trafficdriven dynamic urban population tracking 
it is worth noting that problems ùëñ ùëñùëñ and ùëñùëñùëñ above can all
be solved effectively only using spatiotemporal mobile traffic data
as shown by recent methods proposed in the literature  
 they are thus clear examples of situations where researchers
could benefit from the spectragangenerated data to evaluate
models and algorithms that build on such typically hardtoaccess
data while these three use cases cannot cover the full spectrum of
possible problems where mobile traffic data may support a technical
solution they offer a reasonable set of cases that span different
research domains and aspects of mobile network operation
datadriven micro bs sleeping
the substantial operating expense opex due to energy consump
tion at bss has led to the proposal of a number of solutions for saving
power in the ran we consider a recent approach for trafficaware
bs onoffswitching  and examine how it performs when in
formed with synthetic data generated by spectragan as opposed
to real data we assume a heterogeneous ran deployment where
each pixel of our spatial tessellation is served by a separate micro
bs whereas macro bss provide umbrella coverage to a larger area
of  grid cells micro bs provide localized high capacity at added
energy cost and are dynamically switched on and off according to
traffic fluctuations in their associated grid cell

equivalent energy savings as a model fed with realworld traffic
in both cases power consumption reductions due to sleeping are
in the  range with similar variations across the test cities
resource allocation in vrans
emerging vran paradigms foster the creation of edge datacenters
where central units cus execute software part of the function
alities traditionally performed by bss which are then replaced
by simpler radio units rus the rutocu association can be
adapted to the fluctuations of the traffic load at rus so as to best
use cu resources we investigate the effectiveness of the synthetic
data produced by spectragan in driving a rutocu association
model that ensures load balancing across a given set of cus 
we assume that each grid cell pixel is covered by one ru and
that all rus in a city are served by a single edge datacenter hosting
a set of cus ùëêc the model employs a graph representation
r e of the radio network deployment where each node ùëür
maps to one ru and each edge ùëíùëüùëü e only exists if rus ùëüand ùëü

dynamic urban population tracking
the tracking of population density in realtime is a key functional
ity to support adaptive urban and transport planning and mobile
networks are an effective data source for that purpose we stress
that such tracking is completely different from surveying dwelling
units as done in the population census tracking aims at follow
ing orderofminute population density variations whereas census
data only captures home locations therefore there is no direct
link between the static population data we use as a condition for
generation and the dynamic density we aim at estimating here

in these cities we then compare the resulting dynamic population

mentioned and reproducible as synthetic data can be more easily
shared than realworld data these results pave the way for fur
ther studies considering additional application use cases towards a
complete assessment of the suitability of spectragan as a tool for
the creation of dependable reference spatiotemporal mobile traffic
datasets for the research community
discussion
as the first model of its kind spectragan has limitations that
we deem important to discuss so as to also foster further studies
towards open data synthesis for networking research
first there is no universal spatiotemporal granularity of the
mobile traffic data that is relevant and appropriate for all down
stream applications some studies have indicated that analyses
of several digital human activities are adequately supported by
data with a spatiotemporal resolution of  km  and  min
utes  which is largely satisfied in our case also many previous
works eg     have designed and evaluated solutions
based on mobile network traffic using datasets with resolutions of
   square meters in space and  minutes in time which
are comparable to granularity of real and synthetic data in our
work examples such as those above or in section  show that
spectragandata can support studies on such concrete use cases
however the suitability of spectragan data for additional applica
tions needs to be assessed case by case and remains a shortcoming
of our study and in the literature in general
a setting where the synthetic data currently generated by spec
tragan would clearly be illsuited is for studies requiring a higher
spatial or temporal resolution than that considered in this paper
this may be the case of eg network resource management tasks
that operate at fast timescales in the order of seconds in theory

spectragan could also generate synthetic data at higher spatial
and temporal resolutions which may meet more stringent require
ments such as those above however we do not presently have
groundtruth data that can be used to verify this hypothesis
as another limitation we would like to clarify that it is not the
purpose of spectragan to model the deeper causes that under
pin the spatiotemporal fluctuations of mobile network traffic such
as the activity or mobility of the users while these phenomena
obviously play a big role in determining the spatial and temporal
dynamics of mobile traffic in the network explicitly including them
in the generative process is not needed to attain our data synthesis
objective indeed the spectragan deep neural network architec
ture learns a complex function that translates static context into
realistic spatiotemporal traffic by abstracting various causal pro
cesses in a nonobservable way therefore if the explicit generation
of the underlying user activity or mobility is required our model
is not an appropriate tool
related work
network traffic modeling has received substantial attention in the
literature but largely focused on packet level traffic generation via
packet sizes interpacket arrival times number of traffic gener
ation tools exist for this purpose eg iperf  ditg  os
tinato  and such traffic generation capability is embedded in
network simulators like ns  and omnet  some of these
tools merely focus on the capability to generate arbitrary packet
level workloads with no constraint on realism eg iperf  while
others such as ditg include statistical models for packetbased
traffic generation with empirically derived parameters this ap
proach has also been applied to flowlevel traffic generation for
network intrusion detection type applications see  for a good
survey and for social network traffic generation based on session
durations intersession times etc 
our focus is on spatiotemporal mobile network traffic generation
which is an entirely different problem from the ones above closest
works from the literature to ours by domain are di francesco et al
 oliveira et al  which consider the synthesis of mobile
network traffic at macroscopic ie urban scales the approach in
di francesco et al  requires information on bs locations and
on the distribution of traffic on a peruser basis which are typically
very difficult to obtain and the latter also poses privacy concerns
even so the essence of synthetic mobile traffic generation in di
francesco et al  and also that in oliveira et al  can be
described as fitting the traffic statistics to an empirical probability
distribution and then sampling from it broadly similar to that from
earlier works in the general networking context eg vishwanath
and vahdat  we consider this approach in our evaluations
and show that it fails to capture traffic correlations in space and
time as also acknowledged in di francesco et al  unlike these
prior works our spectragan is a conditional deep generative
model that is designed to account for these correlations only needs
publicly available contextual data to generate traffic in previously
unseen urban regions and is validated extensively with realworld
mobile traffic measurement datasets
more recently lin et al  with a similar overall motivation to
ours have proposed doppelganger a conditional deep generative
model aimed at network timeseries data which relies on batched
rnn for capturing longterm temporal correlations in data as
doppelganger does not have a spatial dimension applying it our
cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data generation
leads to treating each spatial location independently as a result
doppelganger is unable to capture spatial and spatiotemporal
correlations well as we demonstrate in our evaluations
beyond the networking domain neural networks have been
extensively used for modeling spatiotemporal data existing archi
tectures focus on next frame prediction in videos by condition
ing them on an image or text sample  videotovideo synthe
sis   and texttovideo generation  inflow and outflow
crowd forecasting    or learning spatiotemporal feature
representations for prediction problems  while these meth
ods share a similar highlevel goal we target they are not well
suited for mobile network traffic generation reasons include that
such previous approaches are limited to the estimation of a few
future frames  are conditioned on previous frames  cap
ture only shortterm temporal correlations    and can
be only conditioned on nonspatial contexts such as weather or
weekdaysweekends    in contrast spectragan is de
signed to model spatiotemporal relations over long periods of time
and to condition the generated data on spatial contexts we also
show through our evaluations that a representative model from
this body of literature is not effective for our traffic generation
task highlighting the need for domain appropriate data generation
methods like spectragan
conclusions
we have presented spectragan a new conditional gan model
spectragan is the first synthetic generation method for cityscale
spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data it embeds a number of
innovative aspects including the defining approach to generate the
significant frequency components of the traffic spectrum for each
spatial location based on local contextual attributes importantly
the spectragan generation process is conditioned on context data
that is typically publicly available for a city of interest so as to fos
ter its usability we evaluate spectragan using multicity mobile
traffic datasets for two european countries augmented with con
textual data for each city our results show that spectragan not
only significantly outperforms existing approaches that could be
used for spatiotemporal data generation but is also able to generate
highfidelity longterm mobile traffic data for completely unseen
cities solely based on contextual input we also demonstrate the
efficacy of spectragan through multiple application use cases in
mobile networking and beyond
