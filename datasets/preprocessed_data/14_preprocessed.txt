spread
of

has
prompted extensive online discussions creating an infodemic
on social media platforms such as whatsapp and twitter
however the information shared on these platforms is prone
to be unreliable andor misleading in this paper we present
the first analysis of covid discourse on public whatsapp
groups from pakistan building on a large scale annotation of
thousands of messages containing text and images we identify
the main categories of discussion we focus on covid
messages and understand the different types of imagestext
messages being propagated by exploring user behavior related
to covid messages we inspect how misinformation is spread
finally by quantifying the flow of information across what
sapp and twitter we show how information spreads across
platforms and how whatsapp acts as a source for much of

introduction
social media apps like facebook whatsapp and twitter
have changed the way we communicate the information
disseminated through these apps has influenced our social
and cultural norms in an unprecedented way whatsapp is
one of the most frequently used and rapidly growing social
media apps in the world with more than  billion users
whatsapp is also ranked  for the average number of active
users in the world per month 
whatsapp has therefore become important for under
standing social behavior and opinion formation in many
cases the scope of the information shared in whatsapp
groups is limited to a community or a country  recent
studies  have shown that whatsapp like other social
media platforms is also used for the dissemination of
misinformation we argue that it is important to under
stand how this false information either spread knowingly
disinforrnation or naively misinformation influences
opinion formation in different societies this is particularly
important in the global south where despite users having
low digital literacy whatsapp is the de facto mode through
which users obtain and share information 
with this in mind we perform a comprehensive analysis
of covid messages being propagated through whatsapp
in pakistan pakistan is a major developing country with
approximately  million active social media users build

ing on the idea of how political parties around the world 
are using public whatsapp groups to reach their audience
we start by monitoring a large sample of public whatsapp
groups related to politics in pakistan meanwhile a major
world event occurred on march   the world health
organization who declared covid a pandemic 
our data also holds unique value as it encompasses non
covid groups and gives us insight into how covid related
content organically gets propagated across public what
sapp groups specifically we explore the following research
questions
rql what kinds of messages about the pandemic are being
shared on the publicly accessible whatsapp groups of
pakistan
rq is there misinformation related to covid and if
so to what extent and of which type
rq what is the general user behavior and can we detect
disinformation from it
rq what is the interplay between misinformation related
to covid shared on whatsapp and twitter
to explore these questions we have collected data from
 public whatsapp groups starting january  
to the best of our knowledge this is the first dataset and
analysis of covid related conversations from a country
in the global south involving multiple modalities text and
images and multiple platforms whatsapp and twitter
we begin our investigation by analyzing the content shared
in the whatsapp groups and filtering out the covid
related content the filtered content is then further divided
into text images videos and other related categories
using this data we make the following contributions
 we offer the first whatsapp dataset consisting of
discussions related to covid from pakistan the
dataset includes texts images and videos originating
from  groups the anonymized dataset will be
made publicly available to the community
 we show using
extensive
manual
annotation that
around  of the messages related to covid had
misinformation about the pandemic
 we perform a temporal analysis of misinformation
related to covid propagation across whatsapp
and twitter exploring how content is copied across
in this study we focus on text and images leaving video analysis for
future work

a misnjormation on vhatsapp
wh atsapp has been a source of major political misinfor
mation and propaganda campaigns   political parties
have invested heavily in social media strategies by creating
whatsapp groups to reach whatsapp users  surveys
done in india and brazil show that at least one m six users
are part of one such public political whatsapp group 
garimella et al   provide tools to collect and an
alyze public whatsapp group data at scale making use
of these tools various studies have shown the extent of
misinformation and manipulation on whatsapp i i 
  particularly resende et al  analyze doctored
images to fuel smear campaigns against political rivals
and the dissemination of misinformation through whatsapp
groups in brazil garim ella et al  provide an analysis
of imagebased misinformation spread during the 
indian elections and show that over  of the images
contained misinform ation melo et al  provide a system
for gathering analyzing and visualizing whatsapp public
group data for identification of misinformation propagated
in three countries india brazil and indonesia maros et
al  analyze audio messages shared on whatsapp and
char acterize their propagation dynamics the analysis is
performed on k audio messages from  whatsapp
publi c groups and the results suggest that the audio messages
with misinformation spread further more than the bemgn or
unchecked audio messages
b health misnjo rmation
a major focus of this paper is understanding the spread
of health misinformation related to covid whatsapp
has been a major source of health misinformation especially
during the pandemic   this misinformation ranges from
highlighting wrong symptoms to ineffective treatm ents  in
et al  reported a massive wave of misinformation
on social media especially on twitter during the ebola
pandemic in africa more
comprehensie
detai s
n ho
fake news about ebola on social media applications
is
explored in 
with the ongoing surge in the covid pandemic a
wealth of misinformati on has already been documented
sharma et al  provide a dashboard for analyzing
misinformation about covid  on twitter they analyze
 million tweets and provide a countrywise sentiment
analysis of how people are reacting to covid singh
et al  analyze twitterbased
misinformation about
covid and provide insights on how the propagation
of misinformation on social media is connected to the rise
in the number of covid positive cases kouzy et al
 analyze twitterbased misinform ation about covid
 and report that tweets having the keyword covid
 contains less misinformation and tweets with keywords
ncov and corona cinelli et al  provide a
comprehensive analysis of the use of different social media
platforms in the covid pandemic they analyze twitter
instagram youtube reddit and gab providing a review
of how the discou rse on these applications is evolving
they also explore the propagation of misinformation from
different questionable sources in social media
c our vorks novelty
to the best of our knowledge there does not exist any
work analyzing covid related discussions on wh atsapp
since whatsapp is arguably the most frequently used ap
plication in the world it is important to study it to see
how people are using the platform during the pandemic
and how the platform facilitates the spread of covid
 misinformation although prior work has focused on
misinformation spread via whatsapp in brazil and india
we are the first one to study misinformation on wh atsapp
during
a major pandemic
furthermore our analysis is
focused on pakistan which has a thriving muslim relig ious
identity which allows us to see how religion plays a role
in the context of public health in contrast to the majority
of prior work on misinformation which focuses on textual
analysis we also provide a detailed analysis of images
related to covid and study the information spread
across whatsapp and twitter both for text messages as well
as images
iii methodology
in this section we delineate our data collection  anno
tation methodology and discuss the related ethical issues
a daza collection
whatsapp allows its users to create public and private
groups the public groups can be joined by any user of
the platform typically through an invite url of the form
chatwhatsappcom  these urls are frequently shared via
other social web platforms eg facebook twitter to invite
third parties to join
selection of groups to compi le a list of relevant public
groups we looked for chatwhatsappcom links on facebook
and google to find group invite urls we specifically
targeted the popular political parties of pakistan as these
groups tend to be more active and give an idea of the
political sphere hence whatsapp along with political
parties names and slogans were used to search for public
groups 
based on the above parameters we compiled a list of
 public wh atsapp groups in order to ensure the quality
of groups we manually discarded groups that were ume
lated for instance if a groups profile picture group name
or bio did not contain any relevant information political
aimsmotivations then it was removed we further removed
groups which were buying and selling thins  and did not
have any organic interactionsmessages this left us w
ith
 public groups on which the analysis was done 
in order to find these groups a set of queries search
engines and filters were used these queries can be found
at httpsllcuttlyyxhxbd we also plan to release our
anonymised dataset once the paper is accepted to encourage
further research on wh atsapp data from pakistan
whatsapp data collection to join and get data from the
groups we used tools provided by garimella et al  
which uses the selenium web driver to automate the jommg
of the groups whatsapp stores all message data on the
users device in an encrypted sqlite database we used
a rooted android device to obtain the decryption key and
for brevity we refer to covid simply as covid and use these
terms interchangably
authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april  at  utc from ieee xplore  restrictions apply 
and extracted the decrypted database every week the media
content which is stored as encrypted urls was downloaded
locally and decrypted using a public tool slightly modified
for our convenience whatsapp deletes media content from
their servers after a certain amount of time as a result
when decrypting media files we missed a small subset of
the content shared  the joining of the groups took
place over a  month period as new groups were being
identified the data collection started from  january 
onward and continued until  february  we have
complete data from all groups from the end of february
until the second week of april the details of the dataset
are summarized in table

twitter data to compare the data we obtained from the
whatsapp groups to other open well studied social media
platforms
we also gathered data from twitter specifi
cally we obtained historical twitter data on an extensive
list of hashtags specific to covid in pakistan such
as covidpakistan coronafreepakistan and other local
twitter trend variations this gave us  tweets
ethics note
the groups joined had been openly propa
gated on facebook twitter and other mediums and can
be joined by anyone the profile bio of our whatsapp
account declares that we are collecting information for
research purposes we also anonymized the user data before
analyzing it
b identifying covid text messages
we extract covid related text messages using a
keywordfiltering approach we utilize  which offers
a dictionary of covid english keywords we added
small variations and multiple spellings to the dictionary to
capture a wide variety of content related to the pandemic
we translated these keywords into urdu and used both
the english and urdu keywords to search our dataset the
final list includes keywords such as corona coronavirus
covidiv covid covidlv and corona virus among
others this keyword based approach results in a high
precision yet low recall method to identify covid related
messages using this approach we obtained  covid
related text messages between march   and april
  figure  compares the number of daily covid
 related and noncovid related text messages in our
dataset

c identifying covid images
as we see in table i around  of the content is
images hence solely evaluating text would give a distorted
view of the overall information landscape naturally image
content is far harder to automatically categorize therefore
to extract images discussing covid manual tagging was
performed
two armotators tagged a total of  images ranging
from  march to  april  an image was declared as
covid related if it had any of the following attributes
 contained coronavirus covid or any other re
lated terminology in urdu or english
 information relating to a lockdown or any restrictions
being imposedrelaxed by the government on business
or publicprivate institutions
 sharing of any precautionary measures like prayers
for protection from disease herbal medications etc
 contained any
