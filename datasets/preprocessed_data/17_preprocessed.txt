b
ig data has the potential to facilitate sustainable development in many 
sectors of life such as education health agriculture and in combating hu
manitarian crises and violent conflicts however lurking beneath the im
mense promises of big data are some significant risks such as  the po
tential use of big data for unethical ends  its ability to mislead through 
reliance on unrepresentative and biased data and  the various privacy 
and security challenges associated with data including the danger of an 
adversary tampering with the data to harm people these risks can have severe conse
quences and a better understanding of these risks is the first step towards their mitigation 
the risks of using big data for human development

of these risks in this article we highlight the poten
tial dangers associated with using big data particu
larly for human development
data deluge
over the last decades widespread adoption of digital 
applications has moved all aspects of human lives 
into the digital sphere the commoditization of the 
data collection process due to increased digitization 
has resulted in a data deluge that continues to inten
sify with a number of internet companies dealing with 
petabytes of data on a daily basis the term big 
data has been coined to refer to our emerging ability 
to collect process and analyze the massive amount 
of data being generated from multiple sources in 
order to obtain previously inaccessible insights big 
data can equip policy and decision makers with evi
dencebased actionable insights that can help in 
enhancing social systems tracking development prog
ress and in developing a nuanced understanding of 
the effects of policies without being swayed by intu
ition ideologies or emotions
in particular the recent advances in machine learn
ing ml and artificial intelligence ai techniques have 
revolutionized intelligent data analytics resulting in 
enhanced interest in using big data for sustainable 
human and social development bdd many organiza
tions and government institutions are exploring such 
solutions in diverse fields such as healthcare educa
tion intelligence fraud and crime prevention 
although big data technology offers great promise 
 it is worth remembering that big data is not a silver 
bullet and we may ignore the hardearned statistical les
sons on measurement bias data quality and inference 
variation that have been earned through a hard toil and 
sometimes bitter experience only at our own peril 
while most writing on data is enthusiastic new work 
has started emerging that has begun to show how big 
data can mislead and be used detrimentally   
 more than  years of research into artificial intelli
gence and statistical learning has shown that there is no 
free lunch  ie there are no universally applicable 
solutions  and that there are always tradeoffs 
involved 
the use of bdd is transforming society in various 
domains from education to prevention diagnosis and 
treatment of illness  it has improved the efficiency 
and effectiveness of disaster management systems by 
utilizing realtime community information  in these 
applications data is emerging as a new economic 
resource and used by companies governments and 
even individuals to optimize everything  the ulti
mate goal of the development sector seems to be what 
is referred to as forecastbased financing  a 
predictionbased and automatized funding and logistical 
system based on big data analytics and smart contracts 
that automatizes everything from funding to action in 
the field 
despite the great excitement around the big data 
trend big data is also pegged with criticism the dark 
side of big data is that data invariably contains some 
biases and there is a fear that big data could erode pri
vacy and threaten freedom when deployed for human 
and social development these issues become particu
larly serious when big data is deployed for human sub
jects in the case of bdd for example consider the 
case where big data predictions about individuals are 
used to punish people on their propensities rather than 
on their actions this denies human free will and their 
capability to improve over time and effectively reinforc
es existing stereotypes 
various studies have articulated common issues that 
concern big data analytics interdisciplinary research 
    but a critical analysis of bdd is 
missing in the literature therefore in this paper we 
discuss the caveats of big data analytics when it is 
used for human development purposes the purpose of 
this article is to present a critical synthesis of the 
diverse literature and put together various underlying 
issues that affect bdd significantly in addition to criti
cally evaluating bdd risks this paper also explores 
potential remedies that can help mitigate the problems 
of bdd
general issues in using data for decisions

utilizing big data technology to uncover important cor
