modern wireless and data communication systems are a combination of different distributed architectures
which involves many underlying applications technologies and networking policies the ﬁfth generation
of communication technology is expected by the year  with this new networking generation different
allied networking and computational regimes such as the internet of things pervasive computing ubiquitous
computing approximates computing and approximate networking is expected to contribute in building
towards the network of everything cost of computing and networking hardware is expected to decay
exponentially and with that networking cost also decays rapidly this massive transition and new networking
regimes have got research community to think of new alternative networking designs for wireless and data
communication in this section we will brieﬂy introduce and discuss the issues in previous and current
networking architecture we will also provide a list of problems in current networking architecture this
section will also include the social and economic challenges for next generation networking architecture
a design evolution of wireless  data communication networks
 legacy wireless communication network legacy networking architecture lacks the ability of cog
nition they usually follow a strict rulebased policy in determining the allocation of spectrum resources
identiﬁcation of transmission channel interference temperature and many other network related information
these rulebased systems initially work ﬁne for a small set of users with limited quality of service qos
requirements but as the wireless network grows in the number of users and their service requirements
these strict rulebased systems with no cognition ability were not able to deliver the optimal performance
the major reason for this failure lies in the ossiﬁcation of the network design which did not allow the
transmitter and receiver to learn from the dynamic environment and results in bad network performance
poor qos and wastage of network resources
 crosslayer wireless networking communication systems were designed in a strict layered approach
where each layer performed prespeciﬁed tasks and follows strict layering principals to perform these
prespeciﬁed tasks the major shortcoming of this design was the lack of the operational information
dissemination to other layers which is a major hindrance in fulﬁlling the necessary architectural design
requirements of wireless communication system another reason for this failure was the timevarying nature
of the wireless channel to overcome these issues a crosslayer designing approach for wireless network was
used where joint optimization of networking protocols across different layers and improved coordination
among different layers was introduced fundamentally crosslayer wireless network architectures are based
on sharing the knowledge of physical and media access control mac layer of the wireless channel with the
layers above them this information sharing solves the critical problem of resource allocation in wireless
networking the major problem with this design approach is its lack of dynamic behavior adaption of
the wireless network user diversity and different qos demands of users and this lack of adaption has a
negative effect on the tradeoff between performance and interoperability
 cognition based networking the rapid expansion of the wireless communication and the internet
has resulted in a complex heterogeneous design which requires the network to be capable of dynamically
adapting from the surroundings for intelligent resource allocation and interoperability the ossiﬁed legacy
layered network design and the stringently bounded crosslayer architecture are not able to meet the diverse
needs of the new era of wireless communication systems to meet these challenges the idea of cognition
is taken from psychology and implemented in wireless communication network design this new paradigm
was named as cognitive radios
a spectrum access  utilization before moving ahead with cognitive radios we need to mention
another major issue which causes the diversion from crosslayer design to a more intelligent cognition based
design this issue is known as spectrum access and utilization the electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce
natural resource regulated by governments the expected exponential growth in connected devices and
proposed small densely connected topologies for upcoming communication systems will have a disruptive
effect on spectrum allocation and utilization similarly rapid growth in the adaption of new communication
technologies and reduced cost of access for personal and corporate use has raised serious questions about
the availability and utilization of electromagnetic spectrum federal communications commission fcc
published a report in  which is considered to be a very ﬁrst document reviewing the  years of
spectrum allocation and usage this report characterized the potential issues in electromagnetic spectrum
allocation and usage  utilization of electromagnetic spectrum is biased in terms of occupancy of
frequency bands in the spectrum when we sweep the whole frequency spectrum few frequency bands
are vacant most of the time few are partially loaded and rest of them are heavily loaded this uneven
distribution of frequency bands usage causes underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum
according to the fcc report underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum will be the most signiﬁcant
problem in future communication systems underutilization of electromagnetic spectrum occurs due to two
major causes namely traditional command and control procedures and ﬁxed spectrum assignment policy
this underutilization leads to a phenomenon known as spectrum holes a spectrum hole is caused when
the primary user a primary user is the one which buys the license form the regulatory body and regulatory
body assigns a frequency spectrum for a geographical area for a mutually decided time to which a certain
frequency band is assigned for a certain time does not utilize it completely
in  mitola et al  proposed a solution to this ﬁxed spectrum assignment policy by utilizing the
spectrum holes for secondary users users with no spectrum license opportunistically this policy is known as
dynamic spectrum access dsa opportunistic behavior involves sensing the surrounding environment and
adapting to the statistical variations to extract the best possible result this sensing reasoning and adapting
behavior is known as cognitive behavior by incorporating cognitive behavior mitola et al  in the
year  purposed a new paradigm of intelligent wireless communication systems called cognitive radios
which has the ability of sensing the statistical changes in incoming radio frequency signals and making
corresponding changes in certain network operating parameters this reasoning and adaptive behaviour
has two primary objectives highly reliable communication whenever and whereever needed and efﬁcient
utilization of frequency spectrum
cognitive radios introduced a sensing and reconﬁguring approach in networking but this design approach
has some serious issues like detection of weak signals from primary users before sharing the spectrum
with the secondary user it required a tighter control over the secondary user to avoid interference and
this control has killed the whole idea of opportunistic networking to solve this issue a new intelligent
sensing algorithm along with customized transceiver was required another major challenge is to manage
the tradeoff between the censored radius of the primary user and interference power to avoid the shadowing
similarly dynamic nature of wireless channel and diverse qos demands needed a revised rate and capacity
adaption algorithms for cognitive radios to work cognitive radios proved to be a much better design than
previous crosslayer or legacy wireless designs but due to aforementioned ﬂaws in cognitive radios design
it was not very successful but it paved a path towards intelligent wireless networking
b design challenges for next generation of wireless  data communication networks
now lets take a look on the issues in current wireless and data network designs heterogeneity com
plexity and dynamic nature are the three fundamental properties of next communication generation the
communication architecture and the internet were not designed to fulﬁll these properties with the emergence
of new technologies such as the internet of things multicore architectures and exponential social adaption
of these new technologies have rapidly increased the complexity of the wireless communication systems
this has also increased the qos bar for the applications to meet the qoe of the users with all these new
technologies wireless communication and the internet have become a bounded closed loop system with
multiple tradeoffs and restriction to avoid multiple performance issues but now these strict policies have
become a bottleneck in designing nextgeneration communication systems
 network management as mentioned earlier there is an exponential increase in new innovative ap
plications of the internet and wireless communication technologies but we are lagging behind in network
management and this is very alarming given the expected number of connected devices and their diverse
nature network management has lagged behind in innovation curve because of fundamental strict bounded
internet and wireless communication system design to meet the challenges of nextgeneration communi
cation systems and connectivity requirements we need to think a new selforganized network management
systems
 field of view of protocols wireless networks and the internet employs multiple protocols to make
communication between transmitter and receiver possible these protocols are limited in their ﬁeld of view
and information sharing abilities with the complete network whenever we need to integrate a new system
we introduce a protocol in the software and then keep on updating the protocols to ﬁx the raised issues due
to variable network conditions users qoe and security reasons although we employee all these ﬁxes still
we are lagging behind in user qoe applications qos security etc this is because the problem does not
lie in protocols it lies in the protocols limited ﬁeld of view and their inability to model holistic network
systems due to shortcomings the operators are not able to have a complete picture of what is happening
in the network this causes multiple technical issues at the operator which also reﬂects on consumers qoe
although network function virtualization softwaredeﬁned networking and centralized control have offered
a solution of the protocol problem but apple does not the apple doesnt fall far from the tree these schemes
have their shortcomings and these shortcomings have their basis in rule based switching of sdn and closed
form of networking so in order to design nextgeneration networks we need to increase the ﬁeld of view
of a network protocol and rethink the restriction on the coordination among the networking protocols
 measurement  quantiﬁcation measurement and quantiﬁcation process of the wireless communi
cation systems and the internet is of critical importance it is used for network planning and resource
allocation this process is usually decoupled from network control and performed ofﬂine and this is a
major shortcoming in current network design since most of the next generation networks are considered
to be selforganized they need measurement and quantiﬁcation process to be realtime and distributed to
get a better view of network statistics to make an intelligent decision
 knowledge base current wireless communication and data network architectures mostly use rule
based or threshold based decisionmaking strategies for their operation automation recommendation and
troubleshooting process very few applications such as sdn employees artiﬁcial intelligence ai for
decision making when we consider designing a nextgeneration communication network this lack of
adaption of intelligent machine learning techniques in current wireless and data communication networks
is a very alarming problem the adaption of ai in networking along with centralized control and strong
network analytics forms a knowledge base and provides the ability of realtime inference which is a
fundamental property of selfdriven future networks
 tussles current networking architecture has a distinctive perhop behavior for example routing
there are many parties involved in how to perhop behavior should look like these parties have their own
agenda or function that they need to fulﬁll these agenda can be aligned to the network overall function or
these agenda have an adverse nature to optimize the network behavior to its own advantage without caring
much about the overall system this property is termed as tussle  tussles have its basis in different
social political conﬂicting interests biased users p
