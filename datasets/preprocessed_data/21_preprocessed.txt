lynching
i introduction
extremism is becoming a daunting problem in the modern
world the attacks on mosques in christchurch gun vio
lence in schools in the us the terrorism wave in canada and
the middle east religious and racial violence episodes in eu
rope riots and lynching in india and pakistan the genocide
in rohingya etc are a few of the horrific examples where
extremist ideologies on social media have resulted into real
world tragedies governments and social media giants are
trying to deal with this issue but unfortunately there hasnt
been any notable success extremism is a subjective term
identifying and quantifying it is an open area of research
because of its connections with various cultural religious
political and technological aspects extremist content is
an amalgamation of fake news misinterpreted religious
literature misdisinformation outofcontext videoaudio
clips hateful blogs search engine optimized hashtags pro
paganda videosliterature deepfakes and abuse all online
extremist ideas begin in the offline world schools theolog
ical seminaries literature ideas of revenge and supremacy
etc and the butterfly effect of social media and content
optimization algorithms makes it viral this availability and
virality of extremist content increase online extremism and
in many cases into realworld extremism episodes identify
ing and moderating social media content while preserving
free speech and privacy is a challenging task solving
this problem requires content moderation techniques and
platformlevel policies the lack of an extremism detection
and prevention framework notably in india and pakistan
is leading in the continual distribution of extremist content
via social media apps this work outlines a framework for
extremist content identification and mitigation the project
has only recently begun the complete summary of the
project is depicted in figure  and in this poster we discuss
preliminary results using the horrific lynching incident of
priyantha kumara diyawadana as a use case
ii related work
in recent years social media applications have emerged
as the most powerful tool for inciting extremism and
distributing hatefake news extremism hate speech and
fakemisinformation on social media are used to form
opinions cause controversies induce antagonism and so
cial divide curtail free speech troll opponents deteriorate
history namecalling killing and rape threats and violence
to achieve political religious or economic goals in third
world democracies pakistan india etc    
dash et al  studied the extremism and whataboutism
against the muslim population in bangalore india using
twitter data and showed how a derogatory facebook post by
an extremist turned the whole city into a war zone stahel
et al  stated that integrating online and behavioral data
can aid in capturing the relationship between online and
offline extremism biswas et al  used granger causality
test zscore sentiment analysis and other nlp techniques
to measure sinophobia on twitter niu et al  suggested
how a hate indicator can be developed for youtube simon
et al  shed light on the importance of making the
data and tools opensourced to help develop better content
moderation platforms to deal with online extremism to
date this effort can be seen in a few cherrypicked cases
but a larger consensus is still missing  in this poster we
intend to show the initial bits of the understanding of the
extremist content on twitter in the pakistani context through
a case study of the horrific lynching incident of priyantha
kumara diyawadana in pakistan
iii usecase lynching of priyantha kumara
diyawadana
on december   a mob killed and burnt priyantha
kumara diyawadana a srilankan citizen working as a
factory manager in sialkot pakistan on the allegation of
blasphemy the event is thought to be the work of the tlp
an extreme rightwing group in footage published on social
media the culprits can be seen yelling tlp slogans six
criminals were condemned to death when these allegations
were found to be false in court extremist information on
social media applications inspired the criminals we have
considered this horrible incident as a case study to demon
strate how extremist ideas had infiltrated pakistani twitter
we scraped twitter for december  and retrieved 
unique tweets using twinta twitter intelligence tool and
