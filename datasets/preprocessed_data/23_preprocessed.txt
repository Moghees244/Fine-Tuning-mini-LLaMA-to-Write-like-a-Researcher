abstract despite the best efforts of networking researchers and practitioners an ideal internet
experience is inaccessible to an overwhelming majority of people the world over mainly due to the
lack of costefﬁcient ways of provisioning highperformance global internet in this paper we argue
that instead of an exclusive focus on a utopian goal of universally accessible ideal networking in which
we have a high throughput and quality of service as well as low latency and congestion we should
consider providing approximate networking through the adoption of contextappropriate tradeoffs
in this regard we propose to leverage the advances in the emerging trend of approximate computing
that rely on relaxing the bounds of preciseexact computing to provide new opportunities for
improving the area power and performance efﬁciency of systems by orders of magnitude by
embracing output errors in resilient applications furthermore we propose to extend the dimensions
of approximate computing towards various knobs available at network layers
approximate
networking can be used to provision global access to the internet for all gaia in a pragmatically
tiered fashion in which different users around the world are provided a different contextappropriate
but still contextually functional internet experience

 introduction
the new global development agenda transforming our world the  agenda for sustainable
development composed of  sustainable development goals sdgs has recently been adopted
by the united nations un general assembly in  an important pillar of this movement is
the need to ensure social inclusion wherewith the society strives to achieve shared prosperity which
reaches everyone in the society including women people from minorities and the bottom strata of
human society due to the importance of internet accesswhich has now become a key indicator
of the potential of economic progress with impact imprinted on all spheres of human life personal
societal political economical and educational in both developing and developed countriesthe
provisioning of universal internet access becomes an important stepping stone towards sustainable
development the world over
the fact that internet access can play a large role in facilitating development motivates the
vision of global access to the internet for all gaia currently being formally pursued in the internet

 of 
this potential is being thwarted by the inability of billions of people to access the internet according to
recent statistics almost six billion people do not have highspeed internet which makes them unable
to fully participate in the digital economy  bringing the internet to the remaining billions of people
left without will democratize knowledge open up new opportunities and undoubtedly open up
avenues for sustained development
the overwhelming focus of the internet research community has been on improving the ideal
networking experience by providing increasingly higher throughputs along with lower latencies
however this focus has led to an internet design that is very costly which has precluded the
global deployment of the internet we see this in wired technologies such as the modern ﬁberbased
broadband highspeed network which come close to providing ideal network performance have
largely been restricted to urban centers and advanced countries with economical reasons primarily the
high cost of laying ﬁber precluding their universal deployment similarly cellular technologydespite
its great successhas not been able to ensure gaia since it is mainly an urban phenomena that cannot
be used to cost effectively serve rural and remote areas  since internet is overengineered for many
practical applications and needs ie not all applications and users of the internet require highﬁdelity
internet services we argue that a viable gaiaenabling approach is the use of approximate networking
where contextappropriate tradeoffs are adopted to deal with different challenges and impairments
characterizing a certain region we can loosely deﬁne approximate networks as networks that are
close to ideal in terms of quality nature and quantity we proposed the concept of approximate
networking previously in  where the presentation of the concept focused on the use of simple
approximate goodenough services to tame the complexity of the networking infrastructure in a future
world afﬂicted with hard limits due to the exhaustion of natural resources such as fossil fuels in this
paper we argue that apart from its clear use in reducing network complexity with the complementary
beneﬁts of more sustainable cheaper services approximate networking can also be used to satisfy the
widelydiffering and diverse user requirements by taking contextappropriate tradeoffs and thereby help
in realizing the vision of global access to the internet for all gaia
our main idea is for universal internet provisioning of mobile and internet services that it is time
to move away from pursuing overengineered perfect products and focus instead on developing
appropriate good enough solutions our approximate networking idea can be thought of as the
network analog of the emerging computer architectural trend called approximate computing 
which we discuss next
 what is approximate computing
broadly speaking approximate computing leverages the capability of many computing systems
and applications to tolerate some loss of quality and optimality by trading off precision for efﬁciency
where efﬁciency can be in the terms of increased performance or reduced costs in terms of energy
consumed or system costarea approximate computing systems are able to optimize the efﬁciency
of systems by relaxing the commonly applied notion of exact numerical or boolean equivalence
between the speciﬁcation and implementation at multiple layers of the hardware and software stacks
see figure  for a depiction the use of approximate computing is motivated by the following
factors  modern big data applications are based on noisy realworld data  many computing
applications eg recommendation and web search do not have a single golden answer  the
perceptual limitations of users mean that some approximations may not even be noticed and 
many applications existeg images video and soundwhere minor errors and approximations
can be tolerated by different users some recent case studies for applying approximate computing to
video processing  signal processing  and communication systems  have shown early feasibility
the research in the ﬁeld of approximate computing has been led by seminal contributions from the
industry players such as intel  ibm  and microsoft  as well as several research groups
from academia

 what is approximate networking
with approximate networking we intend to seamlessly integrate the concepts from approximate
computing along with traditional mechanisms for approximations in networking in terms of
approximations adopted by networking protocols and algorithms the concept of approximate
networking is necessary since experience has shown us that universal commissioning of ideal
networks which have extremely high capacity bandwidth and reliability in addition to extremely
low or negligible delays errors and congestion is nonpractical it is important to emphasize that
approximate networking is not a single standalone technique nor is it the ﬁrst time that approximation
has been proposed in networking indeed a number of existing networking techniques already
utilize approximation and are best effort our idea of approximate networking generalizes these
classical ideas and importantly supplements these ideas with recent developments in the ﬁeld of
crosslayered approximate computing particularly at the hardware level to facilitate the design of future
energyefﬁcient and optimized network infrastructure as well as algorithms and protocols we aim to
enable end to end approximation principlesframeworks engaging hardwaresoftware approximation
as well as network layer approximations for systematic approximate networking as this point in time
there has only been rudimentary work done in efﬁciently combining lowlevel approximate computing
modules to construct larger highlevel modules and architectural components approximate computing
has been deployed for a large number of applications including image processing signal processing
machine learning scientiﬁc computing ﬁnancial analysis database search and distributed computing
however its extension to the ﬁeld of networking is practically nonexistent at this point in time with only some
recent preliminary works as exceptions  we anticipate that these hardwarefocused approximate
computing advances will percolate into the ﬁeld of networking and in the future there will be an
increased interest in synergistic approximation management at different layers of the hardware and
software stacks in networking
 why adopt approximate networking
 affordable universal internet gaia
the right of affordable access to broadband internet is enshrined in the  sustainable
development goals of the united nations
the international telecommunication union itu
broadband goal  initiative aims at an optimistic target of universal broadband internet speeds
of  mbps for  a month accessible to everyone in the world by  source alliance for
affordable internet aai report  such an approach which aims at providing an ideal
networking experience universally has historically always failed due to various socioeconomical and
technical issues an important reason is that most modern technologies such as g g longterm
evolution lte and the planned g are urban focused as rural systems being sparsely populated
by deﬁnition do not thus hold much business potential for mobile carriers  the internet is also

 of 
large unaffordable when we consider that on average the mobile broadband price and the ﬁxedline
broadband prices are  and  of the average persons monthly income where women and rural
populations are hit the hardest  approximate networking is a particularly appealing option to
reach out to the ofﬂine human population by providing an affordable contextually good enough
service
 diversity of user  application proﬁles
the internets digital divide is not a binary divide there is a spectrum of connectivity
options and digital capabilities accessible to people around the world see figure  in some places
ultra highspeed broadband connections are available while there are hosts of places where there is no
connectivity at all however most places lie somewhere in between user and application proﬁles and
requirement vary greatly at one extreme we have applications that require extremely high throughput
eg video on demand and low latency eg tactile internet on the other extreme we have
applications that have minimal throughput and latency requirements eg smart meters which report
back lowvolume data relatively infrequently users can also have vastly different service requirements
and ﬁnancial strength in the face of such great diversity the approximate networking framework
can avoid the difﬁculties of singlesizeﬁtsall networking solutions furthermore these diversities
can be exploited and applications and users provided services and resources commensurate to
their requirements

ensuring global access to the internet for all gaia requires provisioning good
enough quality of service qos that accommodates the diversity of applications requirements device
capabilities user proﬁle and requirements
 the pareto principle  law the power of good enough
to help manage the approximate networking tradeoffs it is instructive to remember the
pareto principle alternatively called the  rule  which states roughly that  of the factors
result in  of the overall effect this principle has big implications for approximate networking
since this allows us to provide adequate ﬁdelity to ideal networking by only focusing on the most
important  of the effects the key challenge in approximate networking then becomes the task of
separating the allimportant essential nontrivial factors from the trivial factors which may be omitted
or approximated in this regard we can leverage previous humancomputerinteraction hci research
that has shown that human quality of service qos perception can be ﬂawed eg relatively fast
service may be judged to be unacceptable if the service is not predictable visually appealing and

perceive the least inconvenience
 need of energy efﬁciency
it has been reported that information and communication technology ict is one of the biggest
consumer of the worlds electrical energy using up to  of the overall energy  statistics 
the urgency of delivering on the front of energy efﬁciency is reinforced by the impending decline of
nonrenewable energy resources along with the concomitant increase in ict demand the approximate
networking trend can augment the hardwarefocused approximate computing trend in managing
the brewing energy crisis through the ingenuous use of approximation in particular approximate
networking can help generalize the performance and efﬁciency improvements offered by approximate
computing which have largely been limited to local speedups on a single device to broader network
settings optimizing communicationnetworking cost is important since these costs can be signiﬁcant
eg on mobile phones the wifi and cellular radios require on average an order of magnitude more
power than the cpu or memory 
 contributions of this paper
the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the extension of the concept of
approximate computing to the ﬁeld of networking
we propose approximate networking as
an overarching crosslayered framework that encompasses classical approximation techniques
as well as recentlydeveloped techniques in the ﬁeld of approximate computing to implement
contextappropriate networking tradeoffs that are necessary for the aims of global access to the
internet for all gaia in order to facilitate these tradeoffs apart from the classical approximation
techniques adopted in networking in the areas of softwarehardware algorithms protocols and
architecture approximate networking will also leverage the advances in the fastemerging ﬁeld of
approximate computing as an extra degreeoffreedom for ﬁnergrained tradeoff optimization we also
propose approximate networking as an overarching framework for systematically thinking about
networking tradeoffs that must be adopted for ensuring gaia furthermore we also present an
application of approximate networking in g with a case for low income and rural regions
this paper is organized as follows section  describes approximate networking technologies
in section  we present contextappropriate approximate tradeoffs for networking we describe a case
study for approximate g networks in rural and low income areas in section  we present discussion
issues for approximate networking in section  and conclude in section 
 approximate networking technologies
there exist some errortolerant networking applications that are constrained by the needs for
energy efﬁciency and realtime packet delivery by using approximate computing these applications
can be deconstrained by the relaxation of the integrity requirements for the approximate data
thereby allowing these applications to communicate more efﬁciently ie these applications can
transmit faster over a longer range and using less power see  and
