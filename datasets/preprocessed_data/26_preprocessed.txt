of such activity is manually intensive and costly taking days and
weeks after the jammer activation to detect it we present a

i introduction
jamming is the intentional interference aimed at disrupting
wireless communications services and as such can be seen as
a denial of service dos attack   the use and sale
of jamming devices commonly referred to as jammers is
therefore illegal in many countries eg   and any
violations may result in imprisonment or fines eg  
nevertheless jammers targeting all wireless communications
technologies continue to be widely available and in fact
quite affordable see  for example the threat posed
by jammers to robust wireless communications including
on mobile networks is expected to become worse in the
future with lowcost and opensource softwaredefined radio
sdr platforms becoming easily available to arm malicious
actors 
in this paper we consider jamming in operational mobile
networks and in particular focus on the problem of detecting
jammer activity in this context the activation of jammers can
severely deteriorate the service quality in a mobile network
fig  shows the impact on selected celllevel key performance
indicators kpis due to the presence of a jammer using
data from an operational g network we observe that the
jammer activation effectively shuts down the network for users
forcing uplink ul and downlink dl traffic volumes and
throughputs down to nearzero the levels of received signal
strength indicator rssi can also be elevated by over db
x increase with a jammer these results highlight the
potential risk posed by jammers to the robustness of mobile
networks this applies not just to currently deployed g and
g networks that the society heavily relies on for personal
mobile communications emergency response systems and
public safety networks but also for future g networks that
aspire to support diverse use cases including ultrareliable and
lowlatency communications services eg connected vehicles
remote surgery
the jammer detection in current practice however is
a highly manual process that is costly and slow resulting
in degradation in user quality of experience qoe while
the jammer induced interference is detected and resolved
when significant service quality deterioration or network
outage is noticed which may be prompted by user reporting
radio network engineers manually examine large volumes
of multidimensional network kpi data to diagnose the
problem which may also require field testing moreover
when jammer activity is intermittent it can be perceived as
a radio network problem and result in misguided network
reconfigurationsoptimizations thus in current operational
mobile networks according to the operators themselves it
may take days or weeks after the jammer activation for it to
be detected this suggests that jammer detection is a perfect
use case for automation in mobile networks that can not only
lead to savings in operating expenditure opex costs for
operators but also enhance user qoe jammer detection is
also the first step that can enable further troubleshooting to
identify and pinpoint the interference source
in view of the above we aim at automated jammer detection
for operational mobile networks that can automatically and
quickly detect jammer deactivations then trigger alarms to
kickstart downstream resolution processes while this clearly
involves reliable detection of all kinds of malicious jammers
we also aim to detect the operation of other unintentional
interference sources eg malfunctioning devices dect
phones that can cause jammerlike impact on the network
achieving this goal however is hard as it requires addressing
the following challenges
 any available groundtruth label information on jammer
activations to build an automated detection system may
be limited to small parts of the network andor short
periods of time due to the scale of the task and manual
nature of the process so practical jammer detection

methods need to generalize well to be applied to bulk
of the data that is unlabeled
 jammers can have very diverse behaviors some jammers
once activated may stay continuously active while others
exhibit complex discontinuous activation patterns they
also differ from each other in their type eg military
drone specific jammer dect phone the networks
eg g g and frequency bands they target in our
realworld dataset we have encountered jammers that
can affect as many as ten different frequency bands
moreover newer types of jammers with a priori unknown
characteristics can emerge over time
 jammer related activity needs to be disambiguated
from network kpi dynamics induced from normal and
expected behavior eg due to user mobility network
overload but this can be challenging for example with
active but distant jammers
to this end we present jade which to the best of our
knowledge is the first automated jammer detection framework
for operational mobile networks by treating jammer activity
as abnormal or anomalous from the mobile radio access
network ran infrastructure side jade approaches jammer
detection as an anomaly detection problem  jade is
envisioned for operator side deployment and considers cells at
each tower site as measurement vantage points it continually
monitors the time series of various kpis at each of these cells
to detect anomalous behavior over time
at the core of jade are two deep learning based time
series anomaly detection methods that we developed they work
with multivariate kpi data at each cell in the first method a
multivariate long short term memory lstm neural network
model tracks the variation of uplink rssi observed at each
cell to predict its future value and detects an anomaly jammer
activation when the difference between the predicted and
the actual value is more than a threshold the second method
models multivariate kpi time series using a lstm autoencoder
model and the associated reconstruction error over time is
compared against a threshold to detect jammer activation
to address the several challenges outlined above ie limited
labeled data ability to detect new and a priori unknown
jammer activity discrimination of jammer activity from normal
kpi dynamics jade operates in a semisupervised anomaly
detection mode  in that it relies only on normal data
for training the above outlined models this jammer agnostic
nature of jade also makes it robust for detecting jammers
that may exhibit adversarial behaviors jade also embeds a
mechanism to adaptively set thresholds to detect anomalies
thereby adjust the boundary between normal and abnormal
events to efficiently support the detection of jammers at
scale in realworld mobile networks across multiple cells and
operating frequency bands we employ transfer learning 
to develop one frequency and cell agnostic model instead of a
different model for each cell and frequency band
in summary we make the following key contributions
 we propose jade a novel datadriven jammer activity
detection framework for operational mobile networks
iii which addresses this problem for the first time
it incorporates two alternative customtailored semi
supervised deep learning based anomaly detection
methods for the jammer detection task along with an
adaptive thresholding mechanism jade also leverages
transfer learning towards efficient modeling and ease of
deployability
 we extensively evaluate the jade framework using a g
radio access network ran dataset from a multinational
mobile network operator iv
 our results show that the anomaly detection methods
developed for jade outperform a wide range of
commonly used anomaly detection methods when
applied to the jammer detection task and also confirm
the effectiveness of jades adaptive thresholding
mechanism
 we
demonstrate
the
robustness
of
the
jade
framework powered by transfer learning in accurately
detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency
bands and diverse types of jammers
 we also present realworld validation results by
applying our methods in the operators network for
online jammer detection
 as a downstream use case of jade we consider
jammer localization specifically we demonstrate the
potential for pinpointing jammer locations based on
jammer activity detections in the mobile network
using jade and combining them with cell site
location data
next section describes our datasets and evaluation metrics
ii preliminaries
a datasets
a unique and noteworthy aspect of our work is the use of
real g ran datasets from a multinational mobile network
operator for our evaluations overall these datasets outlined
below consist of about a million samples of radio network kpis
measured at an hourly time resolution over several months
training dataset this dataset contains normal data
collected during periods with no jammer activation which
is verified manually by the radio engineers from the operators
network it is used for training the two semisupervised anomaly

testing dataset in contrast to the training dataset this
dataset corresponds to periods with jammer activation events
specifically it is made up of three subdatasets each
corresponding to a different jammers activity over a  week
period these three jammers are arbitrarily named by the
operator as j j and j among these j affects three
frequency bands  mhz  mhz 
 mhz and has a discontinuous onoff activation pattern
on the other hand j and j have continuous activation
patterns which means once activated they stay active until
they are switched off j and j operate on  mhz
and  mhz bands respectively all these three sub
datasets are manually labeled by radio network engineers from
the operator with groundtruth on jammer activeabsent for each
sample these groundtruth labels are key to our study in that
they enable evaluation of different jammer detection methods
considered in this paper overall the testing dataset consists of
 samples with groundtruth annotated kpi data kpis
captured in each sample are same as in the training dataset
each of the three subdatasets contain data for at least  cells
for the above datasets we have conducted preprocessing
steps to impute missing values with the average of neighboring
values
and
normalized
each
kpi
value
via
minmax
normalization we did further feature extraction based on
the timeseries of the above listed kpis following a similar
methodology to the one in  which led to  features in
all besides the datasets described above the proposed jade
framework and constituent jammer detection methods are
validated through trials on the operator side in ivc we
present results for two additional different jammers labeled
j and j encountered during the field trial period in the
case study on jammer localization based on jammer detection
events ivd we also use the groundtruth location data
for j j and j jammers along with the location data
of surrounding cell tower sites from the operator to assess
jammer localization accuracy
b evaluation metrics
here we describe our metrics to evaluate the various jammer
detection methods developedconsidered in this paper these
fig  relative importance of different features kpis for the
random forests based classifier
metrics are defined in terms of four possible outcomes that can
result from applying a jammer detection method which are
 truepositive tp jammer activity detected when such
activity is actually present as per the groundtruth
 falsepositive fp jammer activity detected when in fact
there is no jammer activity
 truenegative tn jammer activity not detected when
jammer activity is absent as per the groundtruth
 falsenegative fn jammer activity not detected even
though jammer is actually active
an effective jammer detection method minimizes both fps
and fns two commonly used measures to assess the extent
to which a given method achieves these goals are precision
and recall as defined below
precision 
tp
tp  fp
recall 
tp
tp  fn
higher values for both these metrics are desired a lower
value of precision equivalently a higher number of fps leads
to an increase in opex to diagnose confirm and localize
jammer activity eg by field visits and testing when in
reality there is none on the other hand a lower value of recall
equivalently a high number of fns shows that the method
in question fails to detect all jammer activation events and
thus risks prolonged degradation of user qoe until the jammer
activity is eventually detected and stopped given the above
having high precision and high recall are equally important
as such we consider a composite metric called fscore that
weighs precision and recall equally by taking a harmonic mean
of the two as defined below
fscore 
p recision 
recall
iii the jade framework
in this section we describe our proposed jade framework
for datadriven automated jammer detection in operational
mobile networks in detail by way of motivation we start by
examining the limitations of commonly used jammer detection
approach based on supervised classification thereby highlight
recall is sometimes also referred to as sensitivity or true positive rate
authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april  at  utc from ieee xplore  restrictions apply 
a challenge that an effective jammer detection method design
needs to address
a limitations of supervised binary classification approach
a straightforward approach to jammer detection is to treat
it as a supervised binary classification problem in fact most
recent works on jammer detection  though aimed at
 networks take this approach and show random forests
rf  to be the most effective classifier here we assess
the effectiveness of supervised binary classification approach
towards jammer detection in operational mobile networks
considering rf as the classifier
since we need a labeled dataset for training and testing
with supervised classification we use one of our testing sub
datasets for the j jammer outlined in section iia for this
study each sample in this dataset is a tuple kpi data labeled
as jammer activeabsent the dataset overall spans over 
cells across three different frequency bands  cells in 
mhz  cells in mhz and  cells in 
mhz it is a fairly balanced dataset with  
jammer active inactive samples we do a  split of this
dataset to create training and test data for the rf based binary
classifier which leads to a test set with  cells in 
mhz  in mhz  in mhz
we first use the rf feature importance  test to examine
the relative importance of the different features from the
classifiers perspective with the results shown in fig  we
find that the average uplink rssi is the most important
feature followed by uldl traffic volumes and throughputs
interestingly the percentage of volte drops has the least
predictive effect on the classifier perhaps because call drops
could happen due to a myriad of factors beyond the jammer
presence eg due to network overload or coverage issues
fig  shows the box plot results for precision recall and f
score metrics separately for each frequency band where the j
jammer operates with each box plot capturing the distribution
for the metric across different cells we observe that precision
and recall values are less than ideal and range between 
 and  respectively the relatively lower recall
results indicate that this supervised classifier method errs more
towards missing some jammer activation events than causing
false alarms the combined effect measured by fscore is
worse with a median value between  and 
crucially this poor classification performance is noticed for
cases with fewer cells and less data in the training dataset
this highlights a key issue with supervised classification based
approach to jammer detection  more and diverse labeled
data is needed compared to getting normal class data it is
difficult and very costly to produce a large and diverse labeled
dataset with jammer activation events more data can be
available for normal periods as reflected by our datasets
where  samples or at least  of the total data is for
the normal category but supervised classifiers fail to take
advantage of such data
fig  precision recall and fscore performance of random
forests based supervised binary classifier
b jade overview
the foregoing discussion not only highlights limitations
with the supervised classification based approach but a key
challenge to be addressed in jammer detection method design
ie limited or no data labeled with jammer effect another
challenge is that there exist numerous types of jammers and
each has its own different characteristics and impact on mobile
network performance eg due to affecting different sets of
frequency bands gathering training data that represents all
jammer types is simply impractical moreover identifying the
decision boundary between normal network behavior and that
affected by jammer activity through the radio network kpis is
challenging due to the inherent kpi dynamics
our proposed jade framework illustrated in fig 
addresses the above challenges jade is envisioned for operator
side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as
measurement vantage points to aid in online jammer detection
it relies on continual monitoring of time series of various kpis
at each of these cells and collecting this data at the operator
ran data lake facility this data is then preprocessed to address
issues such as missing values by imputing with neighboring
ones before putting it through the jammer detection pipeline
in jade
jade approaches jammer detection in an operational mobile
network as a timeseries anomaly detection problem 
by considering that jammer activity manifests as abnormal
or anomalous in the time series of radio network kpis
to address the aforementioned challenges jade adopts the
semisupervised form of anomaly detection  by solely
relying on and leveraging potentially abundant normal data
for model training this also makes jade independent of
the type and behavior of a jammer thereby enabling robust
detection across diverse types of jammers at the core of jade
are two alternative deep learning based anomaly detection
models besides jade incorporates an adaptive mechanism
for these models to set thresholds that represent the boundary
between normal and anomalous samples also rather than
have a separate anomaly jammer detection model per cell or
frequency band jade employs transfer learning  towards
one cell and frequency band agnostic model we elaborate on
the above components of jade in the following subsections
c deep learning models for celllevel anomaly detection
here we describe the two anomaly detection based models
we develop as part of jade for jammer activity detection

fig  illustration of the jade framework
 autoencoder ae  based model  rssi prediction
based model both these models operate at the cell level and
take multivariate time series data for radio network kpis as
input but aim to detect anomalous samples in the time series
through different approaches as elaborated below since we
are dealing with timeseries data we use lstm  cells in
the architecture of both models
 autoencoder ae based anomaly detection model
fig a illustrates the proposed lstm autoencoder based
model that takes multivariate time series as input the core
idea is to encode each input sample using an lstm network
and decode it using another lstm network anomaly detection
relies on the inability to faithfully decode the input sample
with a sufficient amount of training data ie normal samples
the ae model learns to reconstruct the normal samples the
reconstruction error for normal samples will therefore be lower
compared to the reconstruction error of samples in the presence
of a jammer
as mentioned above the ae model has two components an
encoder and a decoder the encoder represents the input sample
in the latent space whereas the decoder aims to reconstructs
the latent domain back to the input sample the encoder in
our model consists of four layers the number of lstm cells
in the first layer is equal to the number of features in the input
sample while the following three layers have   and 
lstm cells respectively then the decoder reconstructs the
input sample from the dimensional latent space the decoder
also consists of four layers where the number of lstm cells
in its first three layers are   and  respectively the
number of lstm cells in the last layer of the decoder equals
the input sample size in terms of features to the ae model
we use mean squared error mse as a loss function and
trained the model for  epochs for every cell in the training
dataset we empirically optimize the hyperparameters with
grid search
 we use rmsprop as an optimizer and
relu as an activation function with a batch size of  since
the network kpis have inherent noise and variations we did
not introduce any additional noise in the input of the ae
towards better generalization
 rssi prediction based anomaly detection model we
now present an alternative anomaly detection model for jammer
activity detection that focuses on predicting the uplink rssi
over time considering that this kpi is seen to be the most
fig  a autoencoder based anomaly detection model b
rssi prediction based anomaly detection model
important feature in our earlier study on supervised binary
classification based jammer detection fig  the essential
idea here is to train a timeseries prediction model that takes
as input multivariate time series of kpis and predicts the rssi
for each following time step the prediction error is expected
to be low for normal samples as the model is trained with
data consisting of such samples but the presence of jammer
activity can yield higher prediction errors which can then be
identified as anomalies jammer activation events
fig b illustrates our rssi prediction based anomaly
detection model which leverages the stateoftheart lstm
based time series prediction model architecture our model
consists of four lstm layers the input layer three hidden
lstm layers and one fully connected output layer the lstm
cells in the input layer are equal to the number of features in
each input sample the following three hidden layers have 
 and  lstm cells respectively the output layer is a fully
connected dense layer with a single neuron that outputs rssi
predictions specifically our model predicts the rssi for the
following  time steps based on multivariate kpi time series
for the past  time steps along a moving window like in the
ae model the hyperparameters are experimentally optimized
with grid search relu is used as an activation function and
the batch size is 
 single and multikpi models we consider two variants
of the above described models
 single kpi model that considers only one kpi specifically
rssi in essence ae and rssi prediction versions of this
model deal with rssi kpi time series note that each sample
in the input time series to these models is multivariate with
 different features due to feature extraction during data
preprocessing
 multikpi model that considers all  kpis in our dataset
including other kpis like uplinkdownlink throughput and
rach success rate this is naturally a multivariate time series
with  features in each sample of the input time series again
due to the feature extraction step
these single and multikpi models allow us to understand
the added benefit of considering the various different kpis
beyond just the uplink rssi
d adaptive thresholding
the two anomaly detection models described in the previous
subsection produce a reconstructionprediction error for each
new sample in a cell kpi time series but to detect whether
that sample is an anomaly due to jammer activity or other such

fig  representative result showing the performance gain
with our grubbs test based adaptive thresholding approach
compared to the stateoftheart nσ approach
interference we need a threshold error level representing the
boundary between normal and anomalous samples correctly
setting this threshold is equally key to effective jammer
detection it can be seen as deciding the tradeoff between
fp and fn probabilities
different approaches are taken for this thresholding in the
literature some works do this manually relying on human
expert feedback to setadapt thresholds eg  but
this is unviable in our setting feng et al  simply use the
median reconstruction error as the threshold which is again not
robust most recent wireless anomaly detection works however
approach this thresholding by assuming that errors are generated
from a gaussian distribution some of these works 
set the threshold based on a desired fp probability which is
not appropriate in our setting as we also would like to have
equally good precision and recall performance
other works  adopt a nσ thresholding approach
for some small value of n where σ is the standard deviation
of the error distribution this essentially means that a sample
is considered an anomaly if its error reconstructionprediction
error in our case is more than nσ away from the mean of
the error distribution obtained using normal training data
while the reconstructionprediction errors across all samples
in the training data also follow a gaussian distribution in
our case results not shown due to space limit we find the
nσ thresholding approach is not robust in our setting as we
show shortly we observe that this is because of the diversity
among cells and so the impact of a jammer on those cells is
also different there also exist other works eg  that
empirically obtain a fixed threshold
we instead take a tailored adaptive thresholding approach
on a per cell basis by examining the time series of
reconstructionprediction errors in each cell to detect
anomalies our proposed approach to this issue can be seen as
an adaptation of grubbs test  for single outlier detection
in univariate data note that the data for thresholding purposes
refers to either reconstruction or prediction errors depending on
the anomaly detection model used and it is therefore univariate
in the following we describe our proposed thresholding
method
we start by defining two hypotheses h there are no
outliers in the data and h there is exactly one outlier in
the data we also define grubbs test statistic to be calculated
fig  average rssi distribution across cells using different
uplink frequency bands
for each new data error sample yi
g_calc  maxyi y 
s
where y and s respectively represent the mean and standard
deviation of the error data samples considered for outlier
detection based on the above we detect an outlier yi or
equivalently reject the null hypothesis h hypothesis of no
outliers if the calculated test statistic is greater than a critical
value as defined on the right hand side of the equation below
g_calc  n 
n
s
tαnn
n   tαnn
where n is the number of training error samples considered
initially t refers to the tdistribution and α is the significance
level related to the desired confidence interval if on the
other hand g_calc is less than or equal to the critical value
then we conclude there is no outlier in the set of n samples
we bootstrap the above statistic calculation with a series
of n error samples ϵ from the training data and view it as
a window then when we apply an anomaly detection model
one of the two from the previous subsection to each new
sample in the radio network kpi time series for a cell we
slide the window and include the new error sample ϵnew to
recalculate the statistic if it is greater than the critical value
the new error sample corresponds to an outlier anomaly and
so we undo the window sliding to ignore ϵnew otherwise
ϵnew is now part of the set of error samples considered for
outlier detection in this work we set α to  equivalent to
 confidence interval and empirically set n to 
fig  demonstrates the effectiveness of our above described
grubbs test based thresholding approach with the nσ
approach for different typical values of n   and  for
the j ul  mhz test dataset and using the
multikpi rssi prediction based anomaly detection model
box plots reflect the distribution of each metric across all cells
in this dataset these results clearly any single static threshold
is not effective generally while our adaptive approach always
yields the best performance we have observed similar
performance improvement with our approach with the other
test datasets omitted due to space limitations

e transfer learning
our proposed solution for detecting jammer activity via
anomaly detection model with adaptive thresholding approach
thus far implicitly considered a single cell scenario in
practice however each cell tower site hosts multiple cells
possibly configured on different frequency bands moreover
an operators network deployment may have thousands of such
cell sites but training and maintaining a per cell or even per
frequency band anomaly detection models is not scalable from
a deployment perspective
we therefore aim at a single cell and frequency agnostic
anomaly detection model one per each alternative discussed
in iiic we cannot however base such a model by training
it on single cell or even single frequency band as different
cells and frequency bands have diverse behavior in terms of
radio network kpis and jammer effect for example the rssi
distributions across cells on different uplink frequency bands
shown in fig  clearly highlight such diversity so we train
our target cell and frequency agnostic model using normal
data from different cells and frequency bands to make this
training efficient we leverage transfer learning tl 
specifically we train the cell and frequency agnostic model
as follows we start with a frequency band and a cell within
that band once the model is trained with data for that cell we
treat that as the start point for training on a different cell from
the same frequency band reusing the already trained models
weights as opposed to starting from scratch once the model
is trained across all cells of a frequency band then it is used
as the base model for training on cells for another frequency
band we repeat this process until we cover all frequency bands
and cells in the training data which ultimately results in the
frequency and cell agnostic model
iv evaluation
in this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed
jade framework using the operator provided g ran datasets
described in iia in terms of the precision recall and fscore
metrics defined in iib
a comparative evaluation of anomaly detection methods
in the previous section we have already presented evaluation
results that show the effectiveness of the adaptive thresholding
mechanism in jade here we evaluate the different anomaly
fig  performance of baseline ad methods on the j ul
  mhz test dataset
detection ad model alternatives in jade relative to
commonly used ad methods  
recall from iiic that the jade framework offers four
different ad models ae and rssi prediction based models
each with single and multikpi versions we train these models
using the training dataset iia we evaluate using the j
ul  mhz part of the testing dataset for
comparison we consider five diverse and commonly used
ad methods zscore local outlier factor oneclass svm
robust covariance and isolation forest to make these baseline
methods work with our multidimensional kpi data we use
principal component analysis pca  based dimensionality
reduction to represent the dataset in twodimensional space
fig  shows the performance comparison between the four
jade ad models we observe that the multikpi version of ae
based ad model performs worse than the other three models
especially in terms of recall however the single kpi version
specifically rssi of the ae model relatively performs much
better we attribute this to the characteristics of kpis other
than rssi that allow reconstruction even in jammer presence
resulting in some jammer activations going undetected rssi
prediction based ad models both perform well with higher
than  values in all three metrics the multikpi version
of rssi prediction based model offers the best performance
overall which suggests that considering all kpis is beneficial
although marginally relatively the baseline methods perform
quite poorly with values for all metrics less than  which is
no better than the random guess based on the known probability
of jammer activation events in the test dataset as prior fig 
these results provide a convincing justification for developing
tailored ad methods for kpi based jammer detection as we
do in jade
b robustness across diverse frequencies  jammer types
so far we have considered the jade performance on one
uplink frequency band j ul and with jammer type
j here we evaluate across different frequency bands
and jammer types to assess its robustness for this study
we consider the best performing model from the previous
experiment as the jade ad model  the multikpi version
of rssi prediction based ad model
we first compare the jammer detection performance between
frequencyspecific and frequencyagnostic versions of the
chosen jade ad model on different frequencies that j

fig  training time gain from using tl to train the frequency
agnostic multikpi rssi prediction based ad model
jammer operates on the frequencyagnostic version is obtained
with tl based training as described in iiie results shown
in fig  indicate that the frequencyagnostic model though
marginally worse than its frequencyspecific counterparts yields
greater than  value for all metrics in more than  of the
cells the training time from using tl relative to not using it
is shown in fig  which clearly demonstrates the training
efficiency gain that tl provides
to study robustness of jade jammer detection performance
we apply the tl based frequencyagnostic model as in the
previous experiment on j and j parts of the testing dataset
results shown in fig  clearly confirm the effectiveness
of jade for these other jammer types the root of the
robustness property of jade lies in its design choice to rely
on semisupervised form of anomaly detection training only
on normal data
c field validation
so far our evaluation of jade performance was based on
operator provided data labeled with groundtruth on jammer
activity ie the testing dataset in iia we now present
results validating jade performance in the field at the operator
side for this purpose we provided the radio network engineers
at the operator with the implementation of jades tl based
frequencyagnostic ad model as in the last experiment it was
used to reliably detect a different type of jammer j with
discontinuous activation pattern as shown in fig 
jade was also used at the operator side to detect a military
grade jammer j targeting different uplink frequencies due
to the complex nature of this jammer activity it was not
practical like with j to manually label the groundtruth
by the operators radio engineers nevertheless we visually
demonstrate in fig  how jade is able to detect jammer
activity on a sample cell affected by this jammer during the

activity that was eventually diagnosed to be due to a hardware
related problem see fig  which shows the versatility of
our jade approach to detect both intentional and unintentional
interference behavior affecting mobile network operations
d jammer localization case study
here we briefly discuss a case study for jade on jammer
localization the idea is to use the jammer detection results with
jade in conjunction with cell site location data to estimate a
jammers location jammer localization is a kind of transmitter
localization problem as cell sites surrounding a jammer detect
its activity with jade as receivers and it can be localized
based on sensed signals at those sites
as our purpose here is not on jammer localization algorithm
design per se but rather on showing the usefulness of jade for
such downstream task we consider three most commonly used
transmitter localization algorithms  max rssi centroid and
weighted centroid with max rssi the location of the cell site
where jammer is detected with max rssi is taken as jammers
location estimate with weighted centroid rssi weighted
geometric center of cell site locations that detect the jammer
is estimated as the jammer location we use the groundtruth
jammer locations provided by the operator to calculate location
estimation errors as euclidean distance between groundtruth
and estimated locations
fig a shows the obtained results for j j and j
jammers in our testing dataset while fig b zooms in on
the results for j case even with these commonly used
localization algorithms we find that jammers can be localized
within a few hundred meters of the groundtruth which is
sufficient in practice for radio engineers to pinpoint the source
of jamming activity between the three jammers considered

decade
wireless
jamming
has
received
considerable attention in the research literature the earlier
work surveyed in   mainly focused on jamming in
the context of ad hoc and sensor networks and  based
wireless lans and multihop networks a significant early
work  considers jamming in sensor networks considering
 networks  examines local and collaborative
detection methods while  focus on distinguishing different
types of jamming attacks more recent works in this
line of research focus on machine learningbased jammer
detection    with most of them taking a
supervised classification approach and concluding that the
random forest method performs the best
closer to our target setting jamming in mobile networks
specifically glte is considered in    in
contrast to our focus on jammer detection in operational
mobile networks these works concentrate on highlighting
vulnerabilities of the lte system to jamming attacks and
proposing mitigation methods  also presents a threat
assessment of the lte system that identifies the weakest
points in its physical phy layer while   observe
that jamming the uplink is more effective for an attacker than
the downlink due to the relatively lower transmission power
limit for lte ues in the former
we are unaware of any previous work that leverages
kpi data to detect jammers in mobile networks by treating
them as anomalies or otherwise but there exist works in
mobile networks and beyond that use kpi data for anomaly
detection    while   are focused on
mobile networks augmented with selforganising network
son features opprentice  targets anomaly detection
in the context of internetbased service delivery  
advocate the use of supervised classification for anomaly
detection based on ensemble methods specifically random
forest in opprentice  and manual labeling to address
the groundtruth issue on the other hand  uses a simple
zscore  like statistical method to detect anomalies at the

kpi level and then uses correlation among kpi anomalies
to determine celllevel anomalies absence  is another
broadly related work that detects service disruptions in mobile
networks using anonymized call detail record cdr data the
essential idea here is to monitor spatiotemporal customer usage
based on anonymized cdrs and identifying deviations from
historical usage as anomalies
also broadly related is the recent work on deep learning
based rfspectrum anomaly detection from the spectrum
monitoring perspective   to detect unauthorized
transmissions misconfigured transmitters etc in contrast to
these works the anomaly detection methods we develop rely
on celllevel kpi data and are tailored for automated and
scalable jammer detection in operational mobile networks our
work is also unique due to the use of an operator provided
g network dataset for evaluations and realworld validations
vi conclusions
we have presented jade an online framework for jammer
activity detection in operational mobile networks at its core
the jade framework consists of deep learning based semi
supervised anomaly detection models that solely rely on
normal training data also jade incorporates an adaptive
mechanism for addressing the thresholding issue for celllevel
anomaly detection moreover the jade framework utilizes
transfer learning to enable itself to scalably work across
many cells and multiple frequency bands we have evaluated
the jade framework on a g ran dataset provided by a
multinational mobile network operator with jammer activation
events labeled for different types of jammers field validation
is also conducted and it shows the effectiveness of the jade
framework in the wild lastly we also provide promising results
on the use of jammer detections from jade for localization
of jammers along with cell site location data
