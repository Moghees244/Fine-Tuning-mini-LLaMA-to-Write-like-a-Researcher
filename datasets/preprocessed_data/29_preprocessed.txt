abstracturban air quality is increasingly becoming a cause for concern for the health of the human population the poor air quality is
already wreaking havoc in major cities of the world where serious health issues and reduction of average human life by a factor of years
are reported the air quality in developing countries can become worse as they undergo development the urban air quality varies
nonlinearly depending upon the various factors such as land use industrialization waste disposal trafﬁc volume etc to address this
problem it is necessary to look at the plethora of available literature from multiple perspectives such as types and sources of pollutants
meteorology urban mobility urban planning and development health care economics etc in this paper we provide a comprehensive
survey of the stateoftheart in urban air quality we ﬁrst review the fundamental background on air quality and present the emerging
landscape of urban air quality we then explore the available literature from multiple urban air quality measurement projects and provides
the insights uncovered in them we then take a look at the sources that are signiﬁcantly contributing to polluting the air quality finally we
highlight open issues and research challenges in dealing with urban air pollution
introduction
air pollution is deﬁned as the release of pollutants in the
air that has detrimental consequences on human health
and the planet as a whole these pollutants can be from
manmade sources or natural sources  natural sources
of air pollution include ﬁres sand storms volcanic activity
fumaroles and others the manmade air pollutants are
gases droplets particulate matter and radiation are emitted
into the atmosphere due to human activity such as burning
wood coal gas oil alcoholbased fuels diesel kerosene
biomass waste etc it also includes power plants and
chemical factories that emitted toxic gases particulate matter
and radiation in the environment these air pollutants
are causing issues such as acid rains urban smog ozone
depletionholes indoor air pollution and global warming
 air pollution is a complex amalgamation of natural and
human activities the impact of this relationship is evident
in metropolitan areas beijing dehli etc where criteria
pollutants meteorology infrastructure and various emission
entities collectively deteriorate the air quality it is iteratively
reported in the literature that  to  of the pollution
in the developing world is due to automobile emissions
where vehicles using lowgrade oil on poorly planned road
infrastructure are major contributors to the poor air quality
 major cities in the world are suffering from rapid
degradation of the air quality that has pernicious outcomes
on the health of the citizens economy plantation crops and
livestock 
a decline in human life expectancy in metropolitan areas
is accredited to their poor air quality the problem will get
even worse with the urban development taking place in
underdeveloped countries  in  world health organi
zation who categorized air pollution as a carcinogen for
human beings  who also estimated two million deaths
per year and numerous respiratory illnesses because of poor
urban air quality  the global rise in air pollution has
resulted in a sharp growth in various allergies and respiratory
diseases the impact of air pollution is not limited to the
metropolitan areas it also affects the environment on a global
scale causing health concerns far away from its origin in
 air pollution alone caused  million death worldwide
and if the current trend continues by  the deaths caused
by ambient air pollution will be nearly  million people
per year  in  out of all cardiovascular deaths
 were caused by air pollution similarly  deaths
due to lung cancer were because of air pollution and air
pollution was the reason for  of the total deaths caused
by strokes   four million new asthma cases and 
million premature childbirths per year are attributed to fossil
fuelbased air pollutants that cause a dent in the gdp 
furthermore air pollution appears to be a risk factor not
yet quantiﬁed in neurodevelopmental disorders in kids and
neurodegenerative illnesses in adults   
air pollution not only affects human health on a global
scale but it also has an enormous economic cost the cost
for air pollution emitted by burning fossil fuels in  is
approximately  trillion usd that is  of the global
global gross domestic product gdp  it is way less than
the money needed to reduce the effect of the air pollution
caused by burning fossil fuels the toll of air pollution on
the economy is estimated by looking at the six aspects 
cost of human life  peoples ability to work  effects
on the food  reduction in the ability of the ecosystem to
work  damages to the historical monuments and  cost
of remediation and restoration the economic burden of air
pollution on the gdp of china is  for india it is 
for russia it is  for germany and us it ranges from
 to  for japan united kingdom and france it ranges
from  to    it indicates that a monumental
effort is needed to address the air pollution is the need of the
hour

another victim of air pollution is agriculture where bad
air quality is considered a signiﬁcant contributor to yield
reduction for many decades air pollution is rapidly becom
ing a threat to food production and safety  effects of air
pollution on human health have been covered rigorously in
the literature compared to agriculture the adverse effects
of air pollution on the crops vary with the concentration
of the pollutants geographical locations and meteorology
burning wood and fossil fuel produce sulfur dioxide that
reduces the life and yield of the crops rising levels of
acid deposition ammonia o and co are also affecting the
crops in the developing world in  india reports a 
reduction in the wheat and rice crop yield due to ambient
air pollution   it also highlights the need for serious
reconsideration in environmental policies around the world
to ensure food security
the global temperature has risen by c over pre
industrial levels the climatic catastrophe is upon us the
whole world has started feeling the repercussions like
wildﬁres heat waves droughts etc air pollution has played
a vital part in this climatic catastrophe united nations

air pollution
air pollutants are particles gases or droplets emitted in
the environment that exceeds the environments capacity of
absorption dilution and dissipation these pollutants are
gases solid particles liquid droplets etc the effect of these
pollutants at a scale is termed as air pollution air pollution
is increasingly becoming a signiﬁcant contributor in causing
public health heart and lung disease respiratory diseases
etc and environmental issues global warming acid rains
reduction in crop yields depletion of the ozone layer etc
at a global scale
criteria pollutants
us environmental protection agency epa divided air
pollutants into the following six categories that provide
sufﬁcient enough information for determining the overall air
quality are known as criteria pollutants
carbon monoxide co carbon monoxide is a gas
emitted into the atmosphere due to the fossil fuel
burning in automotive vehicles it has no smell or
color it reduces the oxygen supply to the body parts
thus hindering proper functioning it also causes
headaches dizziness heart and respiratory issues
nitrogen oxides nitrogen oxide is a gas emitted
in the atmosphere due to the fossil fuel burning in
vehicles and power plants it has a smell and reddish
brown color it causes coughs shortness of breath and
respiratory infections it is also a major contributor
to acid rain that is very harmful to crops plants and
animals
sulfur dioxide so sulfur dioxide is a colorless
gas emitted into the air due to oil and coalburning
power plants and chemical factories it has a rotten
egglike smell it is a contributor to acid rain that is
harmful to crops plants and animals it is also very
harmful to people with respiratory diseases
ozone o ozone is not directly emitted in the
atmosphere it is a byproduct of the reaction between
 httpswwwbritannicacomscienceairpollution
nitrogen oxide and organic compounds under the
sunlight nitrogen dioxide and organic compounds
emissions are due to a wide range of processes such
as coaloilburning power plants factories trees etc
ozone here must not be confused with the ozone
layer present in the stratosphere it is the main
contributor to smog that can lead to respiratory issues
such as asthama it also causes ear nose and throat
ent issues ozone is also harmful to crops and
plants
particulate matter solidliquid droplets suspended
in the air called particulate matter these particles are
inhalable with a width less than  mm and a size as
small as  mm pm and pm are prime
examples of these particles pm and pm are
inhalable particles with a size less than or equal to 
micrometers and less than or equal to  micrometers
respectively these particulate pollutants cause lungs
and heart issues and are harmful to crops and plants
lead pb lead is a toxic metal with many variants
it is emitted into the environment by automotive
vehicles burning substandard gasoline the chemical
factories and power plants are also contributors to
emitting this toxic metal into the atmosphere lead
causes kidney issues strokes and heart failure 
sources of air pollution
sources of air pollution are generally divided into four
categories
natural sources
natural events are the initial sources of air pollution in
the world these events are also fundamental parts of the
ecosystem and also had an associated planetary cost forest
ﬁres volcanic eruptions dust storms decomposing organic
matter biological processes in the soil lightning and sea
spray are a few examples of the natural events degrading
the air quality the natural events result in creating different

types of criteria pollutants volatile organic compounds and
biological pollutants
mobile sources
mobile sources of air pollution are considered very deadly for
human health here trafﬁc encompasses cars buses trucks
trains planes etc mobile sources are also considered one of
the major sources of air pollution air pollution is a result
of the vehicles used for commuting people and resources
 the vehicle exhaust suspended and resuspended road
dust brake dust and tire wear are sources of trafﬁcrelated
emissions  mobile emissions sources result in different
criteria pollutants and volatile organic compounds with
harmful effects on the ecosystem
stationary sources
stationary air pollution sources include power plants in
dustrial facilities oil reﬁneries industries sewage treatment
and so forth stationary sources of air pollution are often
known as point sources the burning of fossil fuels metal
processing processes boilers in industries and power plants
oil reﬁning procedures solvents glues and paint thinners are
all producers of criterion pollutants such as volatile organic
compounds and hazardous pollutants mercury dioxin etc
area sources
air pollution sources such as agricultural areas ﬁreplaces
construction processes in cities heating and cooling units
in the buildings are categorized as area sources of urban
air pollution the pollutants from area sources result in
particulate matter and other criteria pollutants household
emissions also contribute to the degradation of air quality
processes like biomass combustion fossil fuel burning such
as coal diesel kerosene oil etc tobacco smoking and cen
tral air conditioning are a few important sources of household
emissions household emissions create different criteria and
biological pollutants since this paper only considers ambient
air pollution indoor air pollution sources are out of the scope
of this work we also want to note here that multiple sources
from diverse surroundings contribute to urban air pollution
which varies depending on the geographical location of
the pollution sources in the city wind direction and speed
humidity and other meteorological conditions and so on
therefore attributing urban air pollution to a single pollution
source is an inaccurate approach to look at this issue the
relationship between criteria pollutants and their sources
is provided in table  the table is made based on the
information provided by the us epa and nps
air quality index
the air quality index aqi is a metric used for quantifying
and communicating the air quality in a particular location
aqi suggest the amount of air pollutant in the air over a
speciﬁc average interval these air pollution concentration
values are measured by a sensor or extrapolated from
a simulationemulation model the concentration of the
pollutant and time window is used to determine the dose of
the air pollution and insights from epidemiological research
provide its health impacts based on these health impacts
a color code and a health advisory are issued for a speciﬁc
range of the aqi values the air quality information varies
for different countries based on their air quality standards
and thus their air quality indices aqi value for a given
pollutant is determined by the following piecewise linear
function 
i  ihigh ilow
chigh clow
c clow  ilow
where i is the air quality index c is the concentration of the
pollutant clow is the concentration breakpoint that is less
than or equal to c chigh is the concentration breakpoint that
is greater than or equal to c ilow is the index breakpoint
corresponding to clow and ihigh is the index breakpoint
corresponding to chigh
measurement data for aqi is averaged over one hour
there are few pollutants such as ozone o pm and pm

air quality landscape
before proceeding with the discussions of air quality mod
eling and measurement it is imperative to examine the
current global air quality landscape by gleaning insights from
various studies on the impact of air pollution and mitigation
initiatives undertaken in various parts of the world the air
quality life index aqli  report released in july 
suggests that air pollution was the most prominent risk to
human health before the pandemic covid and after it
as well  many countries are now putting a lot of effort
into designing policies for reducing emissions albeit the
progress is slow and many countries are still struggling to
cope with the air quality issue in this section we examine the
air quality landscapes particulate air pollution of various
countries as well as air pollution and the policies used by
these countries to address air pollution challenges
asia
china
china is the most populated country in the world it is home
to  of the total population of the world  of its
population lives in cities in  the concentration of the
pm in beijing city was so high that it seemed that the
city will become uninhabitable  at the time an average
person in the beijing city was exposed to approximately 
µgm of pm air pollution it is nine times higher than the
who recommended value for pm in january  the
situation got even worse when the pm concentration went
 to  times higher than the who recommended value
and the city ofﬁcials warned people to stay indoors  the
guardian describes it as beijings airpocalypse similarly
in shanghai the air pollution went beyond the critical level
there the recorded pm concentration was six times more
than the who recommended value
given the situation in  the chines government
released a national air quality action plan worth  billion

down the plan has three goals
reduce the pm by  relative to its value in 
reduce the pm by  in beijingtianjinhebei
by  in the pearl river delta and by  in the
yangtze river delta
reduce annual pm of beijing to  µgm
the national air quality action plan worked for china
by  the pm concentration in beijingtianjinhebei
went down by  in pearl and yangtze delta the air
pollution went down by  and  respectively this
success was achieved due to a collaborative effort from
different government entities in reducing the dependency
on coal controlling car emissions increasing renewable
energy enforcing emission policies reducing steel and plastic
manufacturing and replacing coal boilers with natural gas
or electric heaters  though these steps have improved
the air quality in china the war against air pollution is not
over as longterm solutions for bringing air pollution down
to the whos recommended values are needed
india
india is the nd most populated country in the world with

indonesia
indonesia is the th most populated country in the world
with a  urban population more than  of its popula
tion is exposed to air pollution that is poorer than the whos
air quality standards indonesia is also facing wildﬁre issues
in  nearly  wildﬁres were recorded the average
pm concentration in indonesia is µgm  jakarta
is the most congested and one the most polluted city in the
world  of the pm and  of pm particles in
jakarta air pollution are emitted by the automotive vehicles
ten coal power plants around the city are also adding to the
particulate pollution by emitting black carbon  in 
the air quality in sumatra and kalimantan was below the
who recommended threshold in the last  years the air
quality in these cities has gone three times poorer than the
recommended value this shift is because of illegal peatland
agriculture deforestation and wildﬁres 
the indonesian government has taken initial steps in
overcoming the air quality issue by adopting the euro 
fuel enforcing automotive health monitoring policies and
developing a peatland restoration agency indonesias coal
based energy production has doubled in the last ten years
and this is due to the tradeoff between the economy and
pollution a lot of collaborative effort is needed to ensure the
better air quality in indonesia
pakistan
pakistan is the ﬁfth most populated country with one of
the highest population growth rates  on the aqli
pollution ranking it is ranked th in the most polluted
countries pakistan has seen a  increase in the pm
concentration in the last two decades  lahore has the
poorest air quality in pakistan where pm concentration is
six times higher µgm than the whos recommended
value  if this level of pollution concentration is sustained
an average person in lahore will lose approximately 
years of life expectancy almost  of the total population
is exposed to pollution levels higher than the recommended
who air pollution values 
citing this looming threat the pakistani government
started enforcing the air pollution regulations for improving
urban air quality in  following three initiatives are taken
to ensure improvement of the air quality
stubble burning is a major contributor to air pollu
tion in pakistan the government of punjab banned
stubble burning and promoted alternative methods
for getting rid of stubble
emission regulations were enforced on the vehicles
factories and brick kilns
for improving the air quality pakistan has also
shut down many coalbased power plants for two
months this measure has improved the air quality
but resulted in many power outages
pakistan can improve air quality sustainably by exploiting re
newable power sources and continuously enforcing emission
regulations
bangladesh
bangladesh is the th most populated country in the world
with a  urban population bangladesh is also the most
polluted country in the world   the air pollution
there is so intense that an average person loses approximately
 years of life expectancy nearly  of the bangladesh
population is exposed to air pollution nearly seven times
more than the who recommended air pollution concentra
tion µgm for pm major sources of air pollution in
bangladesh are brick kilns vehicle emissions cement facto
ries unplanned constructions and steel rerolling  in
metropolitans like dhaka the concentration of the particulate
pollutants pm and pm stayed manifold higher than
the recommended air pollution concentration values the
concentration of other air pollutants like inorganic gases is
noted to stay below the recommended values
given the dangerous situation of the ambient air quality
in major cities the bangladesh government has started imple
menting various countermeasures to control and mitigates
air pollution bangladesh developed  ﬁxed continuous air
quality measurement stations in  major cities the stations
are capable of measuring the concentration of various types
of air pollutants the recorded data from these monitoring
stations helps develop a spatiotemporal map of different air
pollutants that translates into the identiﬁcation of the air
pollution trends in the country data gathered through these
monitoring stations is also used for developing air models
and aqi for public information
on the policy front many initiatives are taken to enforce
the emission policies on brick cement and related industries
by banning the import of coal with high sulfur content
bangladeshs government is also incentivizing the industry
to move towards renewable and energyefﬁcient production
procedures initiatives like clean air and sustainable en
vironment project case and grater dhaka sustainable
transport are also working with the brick cement and
transport industries to reduce emissions strict enforcement
and monitoring are necessary to ensure the improvement in
the ambient air quality and the department of environment
in bangladesh has started doing that
nepal
nepal is suffering from a grim air pollution problem almost
all of its population is living in an air pollution concentration
higher than the who recommended values according to
the aqli nepal fact sheet  nepal is ranked as the third
most polluted country in the world with an average pm
concentration of µgm that is ﬁve times higher than the
acceptable concentration value the average person in nepal
is expected to lose at least ﬁve years worth of life expectancy
if the current levels of air pollution persist the brick kiln
fuel burning vehicle emissions and road dust are primary
contributors to nepals air pollution nepal is far behind in
combating the air quality issues that are affecting the health

and
measurement techniques
in this section we discuss air quality monitoring modeling
and measurement techniques we divide this section into
four major components along with a necessary discussion
and lesson learned subsection the four major components
are air quality monitoring networks air quality modeling
techniques air quality measurement techniques and air
quality data
air quality monitoring network
an air quality monitoring network is used to acquire con
sistent objective and standardized information regarding a
regions air quality this information may include concentra
tions of target pollutants it also allows for necessary steps to
be taken in any environmental protection and public health
safety effort these steps include determination and control
of emission sources and keeping the public informed about
the state of the air quality  madruga et al  discuss
the air quality monitoring network with the perspective
of public exposure to pollutants in literature air quality
network design usually proceeds in two steps generation
of the ﬁne spatial distribution of pollutants and based on
that optimization of the location of the new sensor to add to
the system usero et al  describe the establishment of an
air quality monitoring network in seville spain to monitor
nitrogen dioxide and ozone levels following the european
unions ambient air quality assessment legislation mofarrah
et al  have used the multiplecriteria method with spatial
correlation to determine the optimal number of air quality
monitoring stations in an air quality monitoring network in
riyadh saudi arabia
by far efforts in establishing air quality monitoring
networks are broadly categorized in the following groups
fixed station air quality monitoring
fixed air quality monitoring stations are the most reliable
standardized accurate and highly expensive method fixed
air quality stations require highly trained staff and resources
to manage the measurement and maintenance operation
sometimes these costs even exceed the purchase cost of the
station thus most of the ﬁxed air quality monitoring stations
around the globe are installed and operated by government
agencies in us  air quality stations are installed by state
environmental agencies the eea receives data from 
 and  stations for measuring no pm and pm
respectively
various efforts have been made to create an ideal air
quality monitoring network that can offer comprehensive air
quality measurements elkamel et al  use a multiplecell
approach to create a monthly spatial distribution for pollu
tants and use it in a heuristic optimization algorithm to iden
tify the optimal conﬁguration of a monitoring network hsieh
et al  use a semisupervised inference model to predict
air quality of unknown areas and an entropyminimization
model to predict the best locations for establishing new
stations zhu et al  use bayesian maximum entropy with
a multiobjective optimization model to optimize the design
of an air quality monitoring network kang et al  derive
an air quality inference model using a higherorder graph
convolution network they employed a greedy method to
minimize information entropy which offers a prioritized list
of places for additional air quality measurement stations to
be installed the air quality measurement node placement
method  enhances overall network performance as well
as air quality prediction for a speciﬁc urban area of the city
as cities continue to expand and city dynamics are always
changing an optimal method to analyze and redistribute
the installed network is required hao et al  employs
an atmospheric dispersion model and genetic algorithm to
maximize coverage with minimum overlap yu et al 
use satellite observations to assess the representativeness
of installed air quality stations using a stratiﬁed sampling
method efforts have also been put into developing and
assessment of lowcost air quality monitoring alternatives
mobile air quality monitoring
given the price and the nature of the ﬁxed air quality
monitoring stations there has been a lot of attention to
the development of mobile air quality monitoring stations
mobile air quality monitoring stations offer a costeffective
solution with several promising features such as high
resolution spatial pollutant mapping and crossvalidation
of air quality measurements some of the most prominent

research efforts in developing and utilizing mobile air quality
stations are summarized in table 
satellite based air quality monitoring
the use of satellitebased sensors for the determination of
air quality has been gaining momentum for a long time now
li et al  use modis moderate resolution imaging
spectroradiometer data along with meteorological factors to
analyze their relationship with groundbased pm stations
they use a nonlinear regression model to predict pm
forecast fowlie et al  analyze the relationship of ground
based pm stations with satellitebased estimates and their
effect on the environmental protection agencys policies
kim et al  discuss the launch of the gems satellite
for monitoring air quality they discuss the techniques of
sensing different air quality parameters through satellites
stebel et al  explore the use of existing satellite data to
derive particulate matter estimates and their correlation with
groundbased stations they have also extended the sensing
algorithm to report more on the air quality parameters
integrating satellite data with ground stations
sullivan et al  evaluate the need for satellites to
cover the gaps in the existing installed ﬁxed station air
quality monitoring network and the impacts it can produce
alvarado et al  have done a comprehensive analysis on
the integration of satellite data into a prediction of ground
air quality for lowincome countries they have used two
models to predict groundlevel pm namely generalized
additive model gam and chemical transport model
ctm after analyzing the results they provide further
recommendations on the ability of satellite estimates to
bolster air quality monitoring networks li et al  discuss
the integration of a lowcost air quality sensor network
with ﬁxed ground stations and satellite data to enhance
pollution mapping their studies have shown that integrating
the three datasets can vastly improve spatial distribution
and resolution their system can also perform quite well
under different weather conditions where the satellite remote
sensing data alone tends to be biased
air quality modelling techniques
the environment is a complex reactive system where multi
ple physical and chemical processes are happening contin
uously the air quality measurement at a speciﬁc location
and time provides a conditional spatiotemporal snapshot of
the environment the interpretation of spatiotemporal air
quality information requires a conceptual understanding
of atmospheric dynamics that is not possible without a
sophisticated air quality model measurement alone is also
not enough for policymakers to devise an effective plan
to address the looming challenge of air quality the air
quality models provide necessary mathematical information
for understanding the complex interactions between different
variables affecting air quality therefore a combination of air
quality measurement and air quality models can yield real
progress in understanding and solving the air quality issues
in urban centers
a comprehensive air quality model is supposed to
take into consideration the meteorology chemical trans
formations emission patterns known source information
point of interest poi and removal processes and provide
spatiotemporal emission ﬂuxes and pollutant concentrations
it also highlights the relation between the rate of change
in pollution concentrations and the potential sources 
figure  illustrates the bare minimum inputs and output
of an air quality model the three most commonly used
air quality modeling approaches are dispersion photochem
ical and receptor modeling we brieﬂy describe all three
modeling techniques along with their different variants
air quality is not a local phenomenon understanding the
contribution of different variables in the air quality landscape
is a challenging task modeling these contributions is not
possible through classical air quality modeling techniques
for completeness we have included the famous classical
air quality modeling techniques though these techniques
are not suitable to model the complex relationships between
different contributing variables in the air quality at a scale
many advanced modeling techniques are designed based on
the insights from these classical techniques
box models the box model is the simplest model
for estimating the concentrations of air pollutants
the box model compares a domains airshed to a
rectangular box within which the pollutants mass
is entirely contained  it is used for labscale air
quality experiments it is also suitable for modeling
indoor air quality more information on the box model
is available on  
gaussian models gaussian models are the most
popular air quality models used in the literature to

table  review of research on mobile air quality sensing
figure  a nonexhaustive taxonomy of air quality modelling techniques from us epa
model the repercussions of air pollution in various use
cases these models are frequently used in regulatory
applications the gaussian model assumes that the
plume spread is a result of molecular diffusion pollu
tant concentrations in the plume spread horizontally
and vertically  the solution to the diffusion
equation with varying initial value and boundary
conditions results in a gaussian distribution of the
pollutant concentrations  for further details on
the gaussian air quality models we refer the reader
to  
eulerian models the eulerian air quality modeling
approach is considered one of the most signiﬁcant
modeling techniques it is often known as the grid
model technique in this technique the area under
consideration is divided into equal size small grid
cells and conservation of the mass equation is solved
for a speciﬁc type of pollutants concentrations 
a set of mathematical equations in a given coordinate
system explain the transport diffusion transforma
tion and deposition of pollutant emissions in each cell
 this modeling approach is used for studying
and simulating longrange transport air quality over
the entire airshed further details on the eulerian air
quality modeling we refer the reader to  
lagrangian models the lagrangian models calculate
the wind trajectories and the transportation of the
plume along these trajectories for sourceoriented
models these trajectories are calculated forward in
time and for receptorbased models these trajectories
are calculated back in time  lagrangian model

ing is frequently used to span a longer time duration
up to years these models are also used to model the
concentrations of the particulate matter in the air for
more information on the lagrangian models we refer
the reader to  
dispersion modelling
air dispersion models formulate and simulate the dispersion
of the pollutants emitted by different sources the simulation
provides an estimation of the downward air pollutant
concentration dispersion models are used to predict the
concentration for speciﬁc scenarios such as the change of the
pollution source these models are more suited for pollutants
that react in the environment and spread over large distances
the models are also widely used by regulatory bodies during
the preparation and evaluation of air permit applications
public safety and emergency response personals utilize these
models to determine toxicity in the air due to possible gas
release events environmental protection agencies around the
globe measure the effect of emissions from different sources
and pollution control strategies by using the dispersion
models
aermod modeling system the american meteo
rological society amsus epa regulatory model
improvement committee aermic a joint working
group of scientists from the ams and the epa
created the aermod dispersion modeling system it
is a steadystate gaussian plume model that includes
air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer
turbulence structure and scaling ideas as well as
handling of complex terrain simple and intricate
topography it generates pollutant concentrations
in the ambient air on a daily monthly and yearly
basis it is an updated version of the industrial
source complex iscst framework proposed by
the usepa for analysing the inﬂuence of industrial
sources on air quality in the coming years 
 aermod consists of a dispersion model
for shortrange dispersion of air pollutants from
various sources a meteorological data preprocessor
aermet and a terrain preprocessor aermap
  the aermod dispersion model takes
preprocessed meteorological parameters and pre
processed relation between complex terrain features
and air pollution plumes to produce an air quality
model   further details on various ver
sions of its source codes implementation details
and variable details are available at 
ctdmplus perry et al  proposed the techni
cal formulation of the complex terrain dispersion
model ctdmplus later paumier et al 
provided a performance characterization study of
ctdmplus the objective for this project by us epa
was to design a dispersion model that can model
and predict the air pollution concentration in the
mountainous terrain ctdmplus is a point source
gaussian air quality model for complex terrain that
uses a ﬂow algorithm to provide the deformation in
the plume trajectory caused by the mountainous
terrain it is capable of simulating the ﬂow and
distortions in the plume near predeﬁned three
dimensional d terrain features while remaining
simple by applying ﬂowdistortion adjustments to
ﬂatterrain gaussian and bigaussian pollution
distributions   the ctdmplus requires a
signiﬁcant amount of information on the topography
and weather to produce an efﬁcient dispersion
model which often represents a bottleneck in many
circumstances more information on various versions
of the ctdmplus source code implementation
details and variable details are available at 
ocd hanna et al  introduced the offshore
and coastal dispersion ocd model which can
simulate the impacts of offshore emission sources
on coastal air quality it is based on a steadystate
gaussian model that can cater to the varying disper
sion characteristics between over and underwater
sealand interface and aerodynamic effects hourly
meteorological data from water and land sites is
necessary for the ocd model to predict air quality
turbulence intensities are also frequently used along
with the hourly meteorological data but they are not
mandatory more information on various versions of
the ctdmplus source code implementation details
and variable details are available at  
though us eea recommends aermod ctdmplus and
ocd for air quality modeling they also provide an alter
native list of models that can be used by the regulatory
applications on a casebycase justiﬁcation
photochemical modelling
photochemical air quality models are often used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the control strategies for regulatory anal
ysis and attainment demonstrations photochemical models
can model the air quality at different spatial scales local
regional national global etc photochemical air quality
models are also known as photochemical grid models these
models are used to evaluate the changes in the concentrations
of the criteria pollutants due to the changes in the associated
variables meteorological conditions emission sources etc
similarly these models are also used for accessing the
sensitivity of the pollutant predictions in different use cases
photochemical grid models are also used to evaluate the
performance of pollution control policies they simulate the
concentration of the air pollutants at a large scale by using
a complex set of mathematical equations to characterize
different atmospheric processes physical and chemical two
types of commonly used photochemical air quality models
are the lagrangian trajectory model and the eulerian grid
model the lagrangian trajectory model uses the moving
frame of reference for modeling the air quality whereas the
eulerian grid model applies ﬁxed d geometric models to the
ground to model the air quality of a particular geographical

tohemispheric scale cmaq is developed and
distributed by us epa as an opensource suite of
air quality modeling programs that can simulate
multiple air pollution use cases and predicts the con
centrations based on the historical data of the criteria
pollutants cmaq is used to simulate and estimate
the performance of epa missions for understanding

combination of weather research and fore

of the chemistry into the weather this coupled
design meteorology from cmaq and the
chemistry from weather research and fore
casting component is known as wrfcmaq
information from cmaq such as aerosol
concentration is transmitted into wrf so that
the chemistry can inﬂuence the weather more

cmaqddm
cmaq
decoupled
direct
method cmaqddm offers concentrations
and deposition sensitivity statistics for user
speciﬁed parameters  the motivation for
cmaqddm comes from the desire to mea
sure the concentrations of the pollutants by
changing one or a few parameters out of many
predeﬁned air quality model parameters 
air quality models usually take emissions as
input and predict their concentrations cmaq
ddm provides the ability to the policymakers
to look at the pollution landscape by tweaking
the parameters of interest or emission sources
eg wildﬁres vehicles etc more details on
the cmaqddm are available in  
cmaqisam cmaq integrated source ap
portionment method cmaqisam is a vari
ant of cmaq that measures the attribution of
the source in the overall value of the pollutant
concentrations predictedoutputted by the air
quality models for example identifying the
proportion of the smog created by the stubble
burning in a neighboring city this can be
achieved by running the cmaq twice ﬁrst
with all emission use cases and second by
removing the source of interest but this will
be complex and computationally expensive
cmaqisam this issue by calculating source
attribution of many sources directly by the
model in one simulation simon et al 
used cmaqisam for characterizing co and
nitrogen oxides sources in the baltimore area
kwok et al  used cmaqisam to un
derstand the pm sources and their effects

comprehensive air quality model with extensions
camx camx is another famous air quality
model in photochemical modeling camx modeling
system models the air quality with all criteria pollu
tants for a large scale city state country continent
level it takes emissions meteorology data land use
surface topography initial and boundary conditions
and chemistryrelated values as input and performs
source attribution sensitivity and process analyses
estes et al  used camx to model the exceptional
air quality events in near realtime in taxes to
estimate the ozone impact in three use cases biomass
burning in mexico stratospheric ozone intrusion
anthropogenic emissions in mexico few critical
resources where camx based modeling is used for
air quality policymaking are available in  
regional modeling system for aerosols and depo
sition remsad remsad is another air quality
modeling system that models the particulate haze
and other criteria pollutants it is a regional scale
modeling system that can simulate the physical and
the reactive processes in the environment to show
the effects of the spatiotemporal changes in the air
pollutant concentration on the overall ambient air
quality
urban airshed model variable grid uamv in
the early s the most commonly used air mod
eling system was uamv photochemical modeling
system uamv was widely used for air quality
studies focused on ozone it is a d photochemical
grid model that can model the effects of the chemical
and physical processes in the environment on the
concentrations of air pollutants uamv also pro
vided a spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions
of various air pollutants uamv is outdated and no
longer used for air quality modeling
receptor modelling
the third category of the air quality models is called receptor
models these models are mathematical techniques for
recognizing and quantifying the origins of air pollution at
a particular receptor location  receptor models are
different from dispersion and photochemical air quality
models they do not require meteorological chemical and
emission data to estimate the participation of the pollution
sources in the air pollution concentrations at the receptor
the receptor model uses the chemical and inert properties
of gases so co etc and the particulate matter particles
to determine to contributions of the emission sources in the
pollution concentrations at the receptor  
chemical mass balance cmb the cmb  is a
model for estimating the contribution of the emission
sources to air pollution at the receptor locations
cmb uses spatial ambient data and information

preprints wwwpreprintsorg    not peerreviewed    posted  april                    doipreprintsv
about the pollution sources to determine the source
contributions cmb quantiﬁes the contributions at
the receptor based on the distinct source types rather
than individual emission sources a drawback of
cmb is its inability to distinguish between emis
sion sources with the same chemical and physical
properties more details on the cmb are available in
unmix unmix model uses a formulabased on a
form of factor analysis to determine the chemical
species in the air and their sources it does not take
the chemical proﬁle of the pollution sources as input
instead it generates the chemical proﬁle to estimate
the number of pollution sources their syntheses and
their participation in the air pollution at the receptor
location
positive matrix factorization pmf pmf  is
another air quality model which takes different
features from sediments wet deposition surface
water ambient air indoor air etc to identify the
species of air pollutants pmf also determines the
contributions of the pollution sources at the receptor
the us epa no longer updates pmf and it no longer
supports newer operating systems
air quality measuring sensors
the air quality sensors are the most crucial component of any
air quality monitoring network these sensors are used to
determine the concentration of pollutants in the air typically
these sensors are built with a lego connection for the data
acquisition card and data telemetry is accomplished using
wifi or cellular communication in practice data processing
is done on the cloud rather than on the sensor however there
have been a few situations where data is preprocessed on
the air quality sensors speciﬁcations of air quality sensors
are broadly given by the following parameters
accuracy this is a measure of how close the read
ings of sensors would be as compared to the actual
pollutant value
precision this is a measure of how well the sensor
reproduces the same reading a sensor with low
precision can give different readings at different
times with the same pollutant level
range and detection limitations this is the mea
sure of range of pollutant concentration that the
sensor is able to detect correctly sensor performance
may vary with different concentration of pollutant
copollutant interference cross interference from
other pollutants also affect sensor readings it is
intended to minimize the copollutant interference
when measuring a certain pollutant
environmental interference sensor performance
may vary under different environmental conditions
such as low and high temperature humidity sun
light etc
noise noise is the source of inaccuracy in sensor
readings the effect of noise should be minimized to
produce more precise and accurate sensor readings
 httpswwwepagovairresearch
unmixmodelenvironmentaldataanalyses
signal drift this is the drift in readings which
occurs due to inherent sensor measurement methods
and degradation of sensors components many
air quality sensors suffer from signal drift when
selecting a sensor it should be ensured that the
drift can either be handled or it does not affect the
readings to a signiﬁcant level
response time different sensors can produce read
ings with different minimum time intervals it should
be ensured that the selected sensor is able to produce
readings with acceptable time intervals
multisite measurement performance this is an in
dicator that generalizes the copollutant interference
and the environmental interference of sensor
measurement techniques
a summary of the types of sensors and measurement
techniques has been show in ﬁgure 
particulate matter measurement of particulate mat
ter concentration is broadly categorized in three
methods gravimetric microbalance and optical mea
surements whalley et al  gravimetric method
is widely used by regulatory and certiﬁcation au
thorities it is based on weight difference of a ﬁlter
medium before and after the gas is passed through
the ﬁlter microbalance method uses the change
in resonant frequency to measure the particulate
matter concentration by far the most popular choice
for measurement commercial realtime particulate
matter sensors is the optical method scattering or
absorption of a light beam is measured to determine
the concentration of particulate matter
gases the two major sensor types used for sensing
gaseous pollutants are electrochemical sensor 
and metal oxide sensors metal oxide sensors typi
cally require more power to heat up to very high
temperatures to enable signiﬁcant sensitivity to target
detection gas that also increases the start up time of
sensor electrochemical sensors require less power to
operate and thus allow for fast startup time and cost
savings generated over life time of sensor
sensing solutions
oem sensors oem sensors comprise of just the
sensing element further interfacing and signal con
ditioning is required to convert the sensor output
to meaningful numbers these sensors are popular
choice for original equipment manufacturers
sensing systems sensing systems are built upon the
oem sensors and the output is provided in digital
format sensing systems are available for both indoor
and outdoor air quality monitoring apart from
digital output many sensors are also available with
extra features such as wifi or cellular connectivity
and mobile application to view the sensor outputs
as well as the resulting air quality index for many
commercial and indoor air quality measurement

figure  the ﬁgure shows a taxonomy of air quality sensors along with their working principle and detected pollutants
systems high accuracy is not required and thus are
free from regulatory requirements these systems
are widely available in market and their price is
usually below  the data available through such
sensors is not accurate and it can sometimes produce
unknown errors weather conditions can also affect
such sensing systems
to mitigate all of the above problems and to provide
a standard measurement system the government
deﬁnes a certain set of regulations to conform to
for the measurement of air quality and pollutants

inferring ﬁnegrained air quality
as a ﬁrst step the urban air project sought to infer air
quality in areas where air quality stations were not available
 it is a difﬁcult undertaking since accessible air quality
data is sparse and limited to tackle this challenge zheng
et al  gathered context data from a range of additional
sources meteorology road networks trafﬁc ﬂow poi and
human mobility that have an indirect impact on air quality
after acquiring the context data it is fused with sparse
aqi data from known locations then spatial and temporal
classiﬁers are used for inferring the aqi values at unknown
places the spatial classiﬁer is an artiﬁcial neural network
ann that takes a subset of data and tries predicting
aqi for unknown nodes by using pearson correlation of
known features between nodes the temporal classiﬁer
takes the timedependent factors and tries predicting aqi for
unknown nodes using a linearchain conditional random
field crf the training is performed by iteratively adding
unknown nodes to the set of known nodes that are classiﬁed
conﬁdently by the models for inferring aqi value at
some unknown locationgrid features are applied to each
classiﬁer independently only those aqi values are reported
where both classiﬁers have higher conﬁdence results of
the experiment are compared with different interpolation
techniques like linear gaussian classical dispersion model
decision tree crf and ann the initial step of urban
air only inferred pm and no values for beijing and
shanghai in subsequent work zheng et al  combined
the spatiotemporal model with a realtime feature extraction
database to make userfriendly web and mobile applications
forecasting air quality at each station
following the successful inference of aqi values at arbitrary
sites the next phase in the urban air project was to forecast
aqi values at speciﬁc station locations  forecasting aqi
values is critical because it allows policymakers to better un
derstand air pollution trends and develop preventative and
mitigation policies the method of estimating the next aqi
value at a certain time granularity based on prior aqi values
is known as aqi forecasting various connected aspects
such as meteorology wind speeds temperature and so on
might have an impact on the forecasting process therefore
a realtime database is utilized to give meteorological data
humidity temperature and wind speed as well as weather
forecasts and aqi values for each station site
the forecasting component of the urban air project
gathers data from  stations in  chinese cities with
each instance having concentrations of six air pollutants
no so o co pm and pm zheng et al 
employed the four predictors listed below to forecast the
aqi value at a station
a temporal predictor is used to anticipate the aqi
value using a linear regression model on the data
a spatial predictor is used to provide the surrounding
context to a neural network which forecasts an aqi
value based on the context data
a prediction aggregator trains a regression tree to
give various weights to the ﬁrst two predictions under
different scenarios
finally an inﬂection predictor is employed to simulate
any rapid changes in aqi values and is only utilized
in exceptional cases rain etc
for the ﬁrst  hours the aqi value after each hour is
predicted while for the next h h and h
a minmax range of aqi is forecasted zheng et al 
performed forecasting for  air quality stations in beijing

deployment of air quality monitoring stations
the placement of air quality sensors in suitable places is
critical for obtaining relevant air quality data hsieh et al
 solve the sensor placement problem with a restricted
budget in the urban air project hsieh et al  used a two
stage technique to handle this problem the ﬁrst phase is to
infer the air quality at an unknown place and the second
is to pick candidate locations depending on the conﬁdence
of the inference the city of beijing has split into km x
km patches for inference with each patch referred to as a
node by linking these nodes with known and unknown aqi
values a network is formed some of the linkages are made
with the help of historical geographical and environmental
factors local meteorology road network data and pois are
used to provide weight to edges once the graph is complete
an unknown aqi value is calculated using a weighted sum of
aqi values from known modes instead of only obtaining a
single value for aqi a distribution is learnt at each unknown
node the weights of the graph are modiﬁed over numerous
rounds to get a better distribution minimize entropy loss
for recommending the locations of the station ﬁrst ﬁnd
the node with the best distribution or lower entropy loss
and rank it the last in the list after assigning a rank to this
node label it as a known node and again run the inferring
algorithm to ﬁnd new inference after this ﬁnd the node
with the best distribution and assign it second last this step
is repeated until all nodes are ranked
identiﬁcation of root cause of air pollution
the placement of air quality stations is motivated by the
need to identify the root causes of air pollution urban air
also seeks to identify the underlying causes of urban air

pollution understanding the root cause of air pollution is
extremely beneﬁcial to policymakers in government and
environmental protection agencies because data collection
involves noise collecting insights for establishing the root
cause of air pollution becomes a difﬁcult job zhang et al
 and nguyen et al  integrated historical data with
bayesian learning approaches   to uncover air
pollution causal pathways data used in   includes
measurements of six air pollutants pm pm no co
o so and ﬁve meteorological measurements tempera
ture pressure humidity wind speed and wind direction
which are updated hourly for three areas north china
yangtze river delta and pearl river delta understanding
the root cause of air pollution is based on pattern mining and
bayesian learning the initial stage in pattern mining is to
locate frequently evolving patterns fep it is accomplished
by ﬁrst identifying patterns that happen often at the station
and then applying a projection to them as done by preﬁxscan
 then feps of neighboring stations are compared
and possible causative agents for each sensorstation are
retrieved the pattern mining module decreases the number
of variables which aids in decreasing computation cost for
the next stage in learning the bn structure on in the
worstcase scenario
the bayesian learning module of the root cause identiﬁ
cation pipeline combines the concentration measurements of
each pollutant at the target node with the spatial data from
candidate causers at the multiple time stamps following
data integration initial routes for the n most signiﬁcant
sensor for the target locationstation are created each of
these paths is then assigned a grangercausality gc score
  once the score is assigned to the pathways
the context data is integrated with pathways zhang et al
 determine the number of subclasses using a hidden
confounding variable and then repeatedly optimize the
initial paths by reducing em loss
the urban air project was a great success as it helped in
reducing air pollution in china based on the insights from
this project the environmental protection agencies and the
chines government have taken policylevel steps and the
air pollution in china is under control
aqli project
the air quality life index aqli is another famous air
quality measurement project by the energy policy institute
at the university of chicago epic aqli project introduced
a new metric for measuring the impact of air quality called
air quality life expectancy instead of the conventional aqi
metric this new metric translates the impact of air pollution
on the life expectancy of a human being
the aqli work is based on the pm data collected via
satellite monitoring combined with the global population
data obtained from the  global landscan global popu
lation database  the aqli index is an extension of the
previous work done by greenstone et al in understanding
and quantifying the impact of particulate air pollution on
the expectancy of human life  once both datasets are
collected a gridcellbased procedure is used for combining
global population data with the satellitedriven pm data
loss in life expectancy is calculated for each grid where
each grid corresponds to a km x km area on the ground
the loss in life expectancy due to pm is computed based
on the previous work by ebenstein et al  which shows
that with every µgm of sustained exposure to pm
life expectancy decreases by  years assuming that life
expectancy varies linearly with pm exposure the loss in
life expectancy is multiplied by  for each incremental
exposure to µgm of pm beyond the who threshold
level µgm of pm
the aqli project has resulted in aqli index which
provides a countrylevel loss in life expectancy based on
the pm concentrations this project provides a thorough
analysis of the air pollution situation in many countries and
also covers the policy level steps taken by different countries
eg china india for mitigating the impact of air pollution
on the life expectancy of their citizens though this project
only covers the impact of pm the insights and policy level
suggestions provided in the aqli reports can help improve
the air quality of any part of the world this project is also
an excellent example of how to set up an air quality indexing
study for other criteria pollutants
afriqair
air pollution is a major problem in africa with research
indicating that air pollution causes around  premature
deaths every year  unfortunately there arent many
referencegrade air quality monitoring stations in africa
therefore it is difﬁcult to interpolate the actual situation of
the air pollution the afriqair project tries to tackle this
issue by developing a continentscale air quality monitoring
network afriqair is an african air quality monitoring
initiative  the initiative employs a network of both high
quality and lowcost air quality sensors by mid there
are approximately  nodes spread throughout  african
nations ghana rwanda uganda kenya south africa
democratic republic of congo cote divoire niger congo
etc afriqair has the following three goals for improving
the air quality situation in africa
creating the physical infrastructure required to mea
sure and monitor air quality across the continent it
entails a mix of highquality and lowcost air quality
assessment equipment as well as the necessary
power sources and data telemetry systems
local capacity building to use manage and analyze
the developed physical infrastructure
finally ensure that the physical infrastructures data
and insights are accessible and actionable
the data gathered through these  measurement platforms
across africa is opensourced in daily hourly and minute
granularity and can be readily used for air quality research

ghana is west africas secondmost populated country
behind nigeria ghana is dealing with severe pollution
problems and it is reported that air pollution killed over
 people in   in  ghana started the ghair
project to solve the problem through cuttingedge research
the environmental protection agency of ghana has limited
resources and proper technical human resources to solve
these issues ghair uses lowcost air quality sensors to
bridge the data gap various studies have highlighted that
lowcost sensors might be a great chance to overcome the
air pollution data gap in underdeveloped countries 
ghair has the following four objectives that are also in
line with the unsdgs 
creating a dense lowcost air quality sensor network
in metropolitan areas to collect realtime spatiotem
poral air quality data that may be used to impact air
pollution management policy
launching public awareness campaigns about the
effects of urban air pollution and how residents may
safeguard their health in areas with poor air quality
improving the air quality by introducing behavioral
changes in the communities
performing epidemiological research to highlight the
health issues of air pollution exposure in vulnerable

educating school children to tackle air pollution project
with the help of the royal society the projects goal is to
create awareness among schoolchildren about air quality and
how they may help to improve it the motto of the project is
school children as agents for improved air quality
they are now experiencing several difﬁculties in getting
data from sensors these concerns include the availability of
wifi at deployment sites for data telemetry and sensor power
supply to address these issues ghair is experimenting with
solar energy to power the sensors  furthermore they
are attempting to leverage gprs for data telemetry despite
these challenges the ghair project has enormous potential
for bridging ghanas data gap on air quality
hazewatch
pm concentrations above who standards have been
found in new south wales australia particularly in sydney
the department of environment climate change and water
deccw has already placed  stations in various sites
across sydney and data is published hourly aqi levels
and corresponding health advisories are provided based
on this pollution data unfortunately these stations are
separated by tens of kilometers resulting in inadequate
spatial resolution because of the low spatial resolution
complicated interpolation procedures are needed to report
aqi values as a result the deccw aqi monitoring
network does not represent actual levels of air pollution and
exposure to overcome these shortcomings sivaraman et al
 designed a lowcost urban air quality monitoring system
known as hazewatch hazewatch utilizes many lowcost
mobile sensor units installed in cars to measure air pollution
concentrations as well as users mobile phones to tag and
upload data in realtime the outcome of the projects is its
costeffectiveness better spatial resolution and personalized
exposure tools the project measured no co and o

citisense
developing a countrywide air quality network based on
referencegrade nearreference and lowcost air quality mon
itoring sensing solutions for each pollutant is a complicated
endeavor it requires a lot of money infrastructure and
technical expertise thus environmental governance through
citizen empowerment is gaining traction the purpose of
these programs is to encourage individuals in deploying low
cost sometimes nearreferencegrade monitoring equipment
and share air quality data the integration of data from
residents and referencegrade sensing equipment can assist in
obtaining a more granular picture of air quality resulting in
more effective air quality improvement measures the euro
pean commission has ﬁnanced citisense 
a project that uses cuttingedge earth observation technology
to build and test environmental monitoring systems the
projects goal was to create citizen observatories that would
allow residents to gather and monitor environmental data
in order to formulate community policies the citisense
project produced a number of air quality sensor devices as
well as mobile and other communication technologies the
key contributions of the citisense project were
studying and mitigating hurdles in the citizens in

opensense ii
generating a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of air
pollution requires a lot of data from multiple sources only
referencegrade air quality data is not enough as they are
very expensive and there can be a few referencegrade air

data from heterogeneous devices and crowdsourcing with
reference grade measurements to generate a spatiotemporal
map of urban air pollution and estimate the health impacts
due to air pollution exposure opensense ii project generates
granular air pollution maps of zurich and lausanne and also

root cause analysis of the urban air pollution
the efforts put into designing modeling measuring and
developing cuttingedge air quality measurement facilities
are only to understand the root cause of urban air pollution
and how it affects human health and the global tempera
ture many studies have been conducted using air quality
data acquired from air quality networks to identify the
causescontributors of air pollution karagulian et al 
performed a systematic analysis on the air quality data of 
countries from the who website and highlighted the major
sources of air pollution according to their study of available
data trafﬁc emissions contribute  of air pollution pm
industrial activities contribute  domestic fuel burning
contributes  natural dust and salt contribute  and
unidentiﬁed causes linked to humans contribute  
jiang et al  investigated the spatiotemporal features of
air pollution in six chinese cities and applied the granger
causality test  to evaluate the impact of a citys air
quality on surrounding cities and vice versa according to
their study air pollution is very high in the winters and
early springs and stays low in summer and autumn they
also discovered a unidirectional association between the air
quality of baoding and beijing where the air pollution from
baoding has a signiﬁcant impact on beijings air quality
since baoding is more polluted than beijing 
wang et al  found that particulate matter from
transportation industry agricultural activities fuel burning
construction and demolition accounts for  to  of overall
air pollution in china wang et al  also discovered
that the  extended haze event in centraleastern china
was caused by a shift in meteorological conditions 
employed synthetic atmospheric circulation to determine
the sources of air pollution trafﬁc emissions and high
levels of energy consumption are identiﬁed as contributors
to the haze and poor air quality in centraleastern china
 recently there has been a surge in datadriven root
cause analysis techniques  these techniques are
motivated by the success of big data and artiﬁcial intelligence
ai in many other domains for detecting and comprehend
ing the root cause of urban air pollution we advocate a
combination of traditional modelingcausal methodologies
with cuttingedge ai techniques
urban air quality challenges
despite a plethora of work in measuring and understanding
air quality there are various challenging aspects in tracking
and measuring air quality in this section we take a look at
the challenges needed to be addressed for rapid improve
ment in ambient and indoor air pollution
data collection and public datasets
collecting the air quality data is a challenging task as it
involves different concentrations of air pollutants given the
environmental cost and health risks of poor urban air quality
it is imperative to develop a central realtime air quality
data measurement and processing system two paradigms
for gathering urban data ie air quality data poi mete
orological data etc are sensorcentric data collection and
crowdcentric data collection the sensorcentric paradigm
preprints wwwpreprintsorg    not peerreviewed    posted  april                    doipreprintsv
has two categories these categories are based on whether
the data collecting sensors are mobile deployed on a moving
object or static deployed on a ﬁxed location the crowd
centric data collection is also divided into two categories
activedata generated via participatory surveys and check
ins or passive data generated by users passively while using
the urban infrastructure
gathering air quality and related data via these two
paradigms is difﬁcult because of the following challenges
in static sensorcentric air quality data collection
sensors are deployed at a ﬁxed location and they
communicate at a predeﬁned frequency to the cen
tral database ie cloud server this static sensor
deployment makes the air quality measurement a
resource constraint system limited budget land use
workforce for maintaining the system etc as a
result data gathered from very few sensors ﬁxed at
different locations in an urban environment is sparse
and not sufﬁcient representative of the air quality
situation of the city
in static sensorcentric air quality data collection
where the number of sensors is limited the optimal
placement of the air quality sensors for gathering
representative enough data becomes a challenge
though mobile sensorcentric data collection help
resolve the issues faced in air quality data gathering
due to the ﬁxed nature of the static sensorcentric
approach it has its challenges the air quality data
gathered from the sensors mounted on moving objects
such as buses bikes taxis uavs etc is skewed by
the movement of these moving objects for example
buses are usually used as a means of the commute
from a busy ﬁxed route the gathered data will
provide a good representation of the air quality along
the buss route but it will not provide a true depiction
of urban air quality
another challenge in mobile sensorcentric air quality
data is the redundancy in the collected data since the
sensorsmounted vehicle will be following a route es
pecially buses the data collected will be redundant
and the data from less traversed routes will be sparse
it will result in an imbalanced data distribution any
deduction made from the distribution will be biased
towards the most frequent route
human as a sensor is another way of getting the
data for inferring the air quality data generated
by the citizens passively while accessing the urban
infrastructure call data record public wiﬁ passenger
bus card swipes taxi pick and drop locations etc is
useful in determining the context of urban pollution
here the key challenges are the privacy of the users
the security of the service providers and meeting the
legal requirements of data protection
participatory crowdsensing is a procedure opted for
gathering the context data used for inferring the urban
air quality where the measurement campaigns and
surveys are used to collect the data imbalance data
coverage unavailability of ground truth to measure
the quality of the collected air quality data and
noisy and fake data reporting are a few challenges
associated with the participatory crowdsensing for air
qualityrelated data
to overcome these challenges in air quality data collection
along with its proper context requires a great deal of planning
and understanding of the urban environment selecting the
right kind of sensors an acceptable level of measurement
granularity designing a proper measurement campaign
choosing the appropriate clouddatabase and ensuring the
quality of the collected air pollution data and the motivation
to make it public can help develop a comprehensive air
quality dataset for determining the correct air quality values
nevertheless a hybrid approach combining sensorcentric
expertintheloop data collection techniques can yield better
air quality data collection
air quality monitoring networks in underdeveloped
countries
the air quality situation in underdeveloped nations is dire
yet they are unable to address it due to a lack of air quality
monitoring networks deploying these networks across the
country necessitates large sums of money and planning that
in many underdeveloped countries is not available without
an adequate and extensive air quality monitoring network
in place economically developing nations are unable to
gather air quality data and as a result lack policies for
monitoring and combating air pollution trends lowcost air
quality monitoring stations are used instead of actual weather
stations and deployed in a few countries developing a
countrywide lowcost air quality sensorsbased network
remains a very challenging task
tradeoff between economic growth and air pollu
tion
the tradeoff between economic growth and air pollution im
plies that economic expansion is connected to industrializa
tion and transportation which necessitates the combustion of
gasoline and other energy sources resulting in air pollution
finding the right balance between economic growth and
air pollution is a daunting task for many countries other
variables such as population urban density and urban
planning exacerbate the difﬁculty of this task
regularization and air quality measurements
even though there are several environmental regulatory
bodies and a plethora of regulatory rules but we continue to
see that air quality in urban areas is becoming a predicament
the implementation of these standards is an issue that
many governments are unable to address for a variety of
reasons including a lack of education ﬁnancial resources
political and religious divisions lack of global and regional
cooperation and so on 
urban planning and air quality
urban planning plays a vital role in improving the air
quality of the city unfortunately many metropolitans around
the world are suffering from the worst air quality due to
exponential growth in population trafﬁc congestions high
built densities and lack of urban planning canyon street the
preprints wwwpreprintsorg    not peerreviewed    posted  april                    doipreprintsv
street design in which both sides of the roadway are bordered
by buildings has a poor dispersion rate thus vehicle exhaust
remains in greater quantities than usual producing severe
health issues and air pollution avoiding canyon street design
in urban planning might help to reduce urban air pollution
reducing urban air pollution from trafﬁc is strongly linked to
initiatives for encouraging active commuting travel by low
energyconsuming vehicles and lowering carbon emissions
urban planning and its relationship with different urban
environmental concerns is an area in which much ingenuity
is required
personalized contextaware air quality measure
ment applications
designing contextaware air quality monitoring systems are
gaining traction air quality is heavily reliant on several
context factors pois meteorology etc and interpreting
air quality measurements without taking the context into
account might create bias in the measurements people
with respiratory or ocular diseases are especially sensitive
to air pollution and should be warned about it the aqi
measurements are insufﬁcient for these patients it is very
challenging to develop contextaware custommade air qual
ity monitoring applications a few emerging applications use
the internet of things iot and tailored context to deliver
customized warnings on the severity of air pollution in a
speciﬁc city location  
impact of climate change on the air quality
climate change has started causing many problems in
different parts of the world climate change can inﬂuence the
local air quality and vice versa an increase in the ground
level o is observed as the atmosphere gets warmer due
to climate change and this groundlevel o is expected to
cause dense smogs in urban areas the jury is out on the
effectiveness of climate change on particulate matterbased
air pollution 
indoor air pollution
air quality within the buildings houses schools shopping
malls airports etc concerning the health of the people
health is termed as indoor air quality iaq it is described
in the literature that the iaq in homes is  to  times
more polluted than the ambient air pollution  co
microbiological contamination owing to moisture insufﬁ
cient ventilation fuel burning incorrect building design
and commonly used construction materials are a few of
the causes of increased indoor air pollution levels long
term respiratory disorders cancer heart disease and short
term ent irritations headaches tiredness nausea health
problems can be caused by poor iaq people have been
staying indoors for the last two years as a result of the covid
 restriction and indoor air pollution in homes  
and hospitals has skyrocketed  with this exceptional
circumstance iaq improvement is both vital and challenging

conclusions
