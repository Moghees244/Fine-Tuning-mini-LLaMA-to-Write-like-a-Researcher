abstract
the spread of covid and the lockdowns that followed led to an increase in activity on online social networks this has 
resulted in users sharing unfiltered and unreliable information on social networks like whatsapp twitter facebook etc in 
this work we give an extended overview of how pakistans population used public whatsapp groups for sharing informa
tion related to the pandemic our work is based on a major effort to annotate thousands of text and imagebased messages 
we explore how information propagates across whatsapp and the user behavior around it specifically we look at political 
polarization and its impact on how users from different political parties shared covidrelated content we also try to 
understand information dissemination across different social networkstwitter and whatsappin pakistan and find that 
there is no significant bot involvement in spreading misinformation about the pandemic

  introduction
applications like twitter facebook and whatsapp are ena
bling millions of users to connect and interact this has led 
to sharing ideas getting exposed to different ideologies and 
absorbing information at an unprecedented pace out of all 
these services and apps whatsapp is the most popular and 
widely used medium of communication this has created a 
closed social network of more than  billion users apart 
from having a huge user base it also has the most active 
users at a time out of all the social networks two billion 
users 
this makes whatsapp a very important medium for anal
ysis as it is a major tool for opinion formation and social 
exchange due to its endtoend encryption it is becoming a 
medium of choice for antigovernment movements sharing 
of radical ideas and gang operations uk says whatsapp 
 similarly whatsapp is also used for the propagation 
of antisocial behavior a study on brazils whatsapp users 
resende et al a revealed how whatsapp can be an 
effective tool for the spread of disinformation a study con
ducted in india saha et al  revealed the spread of hate 
speech and islamophobia on whatsapp these problems are 
exacerbated by the fact that content moderation in what
sapp is rather limited the content of a group is only mod
erated by the groups administrators admins have very few

tools at hand either restrict who can post content or remove 
certain users from the group group admins cannot even do 
the simple moderation task of deleting a users post as a 
result the moderation abilities on whatsapp are very scant
this work is an extended version of our earlier prelimi
nary analysis of covidrelated messages being dis
seminated across public whatsapp groups by pakistani 
users javed et al  in this extended version in addi
tion to looking at the type of messages being disseminated 
across covid in pakistani whatsapp groups we also 
try to understand the impact that political affiliation has on 
a groups overall sentiment related to covid and the 
types of messages being propagated our main research 
questions are 
rq	
what type of messages about covid are dis
seminated in public whatsapp groups of pakistan
rq	
what is the general user behavior when sharing a 
message specifically is there a connection between a 
groups political affiliation and the content that is being 
shared
rq	
is there reciprocation between information dis
semination related to covid over whatsapp and 
twitter
rq	
what type of sentiment is expressed by users when 
sharing covid messages does this vary on the 
basis of political affiliation
to answer these research questions we have gathered the 
data from  publicly accessible whatsapp groups during 
january  april   this dataset is the first of 
its kind giving us a unique opportunity to analyze covid
related discussion from one of the largest countries in the 
world involving a multimodal environmentimages and 
textand multiple social networking platforms of commu
nicationwhatsapp and twitter
we start by analyzing the content disseminated in these 
 public groups and extract the covidrelated 
content out of them extracted content is separated into 
image video text documents and links using our dataset 
which we make publicly available we make the following 
contributions
	 we analyze the groups and messages therein with a focus 
on political affiliations
	 we give an overview of how users with different political 
affinities spread covidrelated messages we also 
show that on average  of the content shared is mis
information
	 we give an overview of the prevailing sentiment of 
covid posts and find that the sentiment is mostly 
negative

misinformation on social media
many studies have been conducted that gave a special focus 
to rumors and misinformation prior to the events of the 
 us presidential elections starbird et al  how
ever the events of the us presidential election have since 
triggered a flurry of work on this topic as a result there 
have been many papers attempting to understand the impact 
social media has the amount of misinformation present on 
it and the amount of exposure users have to this informa
tion david et al  iosifidis and nicoli  bovet 
and makse  for example during the  elections 
social media were used extensively to manipulate social 
media users to sway their political inclinations grinberg 
et al  analyzed twitter to understand the extent of 
political manipulation present during this period similarly 
badawy et al  used twitter to understand the effects 
the russian internet research agency might have had on 
american twitter users they characterize the interactions 
of twitter republican and democratic users with the rus
sian trolls
there are various methods for detecting misinformation 
they can be divided into two major approaches content
based and propagationbased habib et al  performed 
a systematic literature review to understand different meth
odologies for detecting misinformation in online social net
works chen et al  performed an analysis of twitter to 
understand different types of misinformation their analysis 
relied on a graph of users based on the content they share in 
other similar works zollo and quattrociocchi  cinelli 
et al  the authors provide analysis on social media 
users and their interactions with controversial topics and 
content a study on instagram was conducted by trevisan 
et al  where they gave detailed insights on how users 
interact with political content similarly many researchers 
have conducted independent studies in line with those men
tioned earlier zhang and ghorbani  shu et al

network without any official access for analyzing its con
tent as a result not a lot of work has been done to analyze 
its content and user interactions it is a documented fact that 
whatsapp is being actively used for the dissemination of 
misinformation boadle  perrigo  due to the 
popularity of whatsapp in certain regions political par
ties have been actively using whatsapp groups to reach 
the masses goel  surveys performed in brazil and 
india lokniti  newman et al  two of the largest 
democracies show that one in six users are part of a political 
group on whatsapp
garimella and tyson  were the first to provide 
tools for analyzing public whatsapp groups and collecting 
data at scale these tools have enabled researchers to study 
whatsapp at scale and created a window into the world 
of whatsapp some of the recent studies can be found 
at evangelista and bruno  resende et al b 
yadav et al  garimella and eckles  where 
researchers analyzed public whatsapp groups in various 
contexts resende et al  gave a unique insight by ana
lyzing doctored images used to fuel political smear cam
paigns against opposing parties on public whatsapp groups 
in brazil similarly garimella and eckles  analyze 
the images in indian whatsapp groups during the  
indian elections the study found that  of the images 
contained misinformation using reverse image search on 
google images in parallel melo et al  gather ana
lyze and visualize public whatsapp groups and identify 
the extent of misinformation found in india indonesia and 
brazil apart from text messages and images whatsapp has 
a large content of audio files maros et al  analyzed 
 public whatsapp groups and proposed that audio mes
sages containing misinformation spread much more farther 
and wider
  
the covid infodemic
our work revolves around understanding health informa
tion being shared on whatsapp and how users interact 
with it while considering the political inclination of users 
the covid pandemic has also created an infodemic as 
declared by the world health organization an infodemic 
refers to the inflow of information that is so large that users 
are unable to discriminate effectively between misinfor
mation and correct information it is already documented 
that whatsapp is a source of misinformation related to 
health purnell  ranging from wrong symptoms to 
ineffective treatments bhatnagar and choubey  javed 
et al  this makes it critical to understand the health 
content present in whatsapp groups
apart from whatsapp researchers have provided a dash
board to analyze health misinformation on twitter sharma 
et al  they analyze  million tweets and also perform 
a countrywide analysis of sentiment they also provide 
an uptodate view of how people are reacting to covid
related content on twitter similarly singh et al  
look at twitter based misinformation about covid and 
give insights about the propagation of misinformation on 
online social networks is in line with the rise of cases in a 
given demographic another study on twitter kouzy et al 
 found that some tags have more misinformation than 
others pointing toward potential safe tags on twitter cinelli 
et al  analyze different social networks for covid
related content they analyze twitter instagram reddit 
gab and youtube giving a comprehensive picture of the 
state of covid content on these websites they not only 
do content analysis but also try to understand the propaga
tion of misinformation on these social networks
  
our works novelty
this work is an extension of our previous work javed et al 
 in this study we analyze covidrelated discus
sions on whatsapp and explore the political influence in 
this context since whatsapp is a popular and frequently 
used application it is critical to understand how the popu
lace is utilizing the platform during the pandemic and how 
the platform facilitates the spread of misinformation while 
doing so we extract valuable insights from the dataset and 
try to quantify how misinformation and politics can be 
intertwined
studies have been conducted to analyze whatsapp mes
sages for political events in brazil and india on the con
trary this study tries to understand the impact whatsapp is 
having on the infodemic in pakistan while considering the 
political nature of our groups since pakistan is a muslim 
majority country religion is relevant in the daily life of the 
pakistani citizens we offer a first insight into how religion 
and politics together play a role in this infodemic
  
methodology
we use a multitude of techniques for data collection annota
tion and analysis of data we also create novel algorithms 
to better understand the content being shared the details of 
these methods are discussed below
  
dataset preparation
whatsapp allows its user base to create either public or 
private whatsapp groups a private group can only be 
joined through an invite which is sent by the admin himself

whereas for the public groups whatsapp allows users to 
enable joining these groups by means of an invite url this 
invite url can be shared by any number of users and the 
users can join a group by clicking this url the invite url 
has a specific structure of the form chat
whats
app
com
 
many groups eg for politics sports religion share these 
invite urls on social networks for easy visibility hence 
increasing their community size and reach
group selection leveraging the unique structure of pub
lic whatsapp groups we used facebook and google search 
to find whatsapp invite urls to ensure we find groups 
from pakistani political parties the url was often used in 
conjunction with a political partys name or pakistan we 
also used pakistani ip to ensure google and facebook give 
results from pakistan as a priority we also used the keyword 
whatsapp along with political parties names or slogans 
all of these queries have been logged for the convenience 
of new researchers in this domain and can be found online
following these techniques we found in total  public 
pakistani whatsapp groups a loose criterion was set to 
make sure the groups joined are in line with our research 
goals and will provide meaningful value to the overall data
set we manually analyzed a groups bio name and profile 
pic if any of these were not in line with our research goals 
the group was removed from our dataset removed groups 
mostly were sales purchase groups or groups made only 
for sharing jokes furthermore we analyzed the remaining 
groups for activity over a week in case a group did not have 
any significant activity or the activity was not organic eg 
a sales group they were removed from our dataset after 
these pruning steps a total of  public groups were used 
to provide the analysis that follows
whatsapp data collection to join these groups we 
relied extensively on the tools created and provided by gari
mella and tyson  these tools use selenium enabling 
automated joining of public whatsapp groups whatsapp 
messages are stored on a users device in an encrypted form 
and is further protected by being placed in the root folder 
the root folder is a secure folder and users do not have 
access to it a rooted android phone having an unlocked 
bootloader and root folder was used to obtain the decrypted 
database the database is located in the datadata folder of 
the root drive the media contents images videos are 
stored online on whatsapp servers and need to be accessed 
using the urls provided in the database using these urls 
we downloaded images locally and decrypted them using 
a public tool this tool was not functional out of the box 
hence it was modified for our convenience and ease dur
ing our data collection it was observed that whatsapp 
periodically deletes content from their servers as a result 
if a media file was not downloaded in a respectable amount 
of time the media content could not be retrieved hence 
a pipeline was created to extract data on weekly basis an 
overview of our dataset can be seen in table 
  
annotating covid text messages
covid text messages were extracted using a keyword
filtering approach rashed et al  provide a diction
ary of keywords related to covid we used that and 
translated these words into equivalent urdu terms we also 
added small variations to these terms like spelling mis
takes and multiple spellings to ensure that we capture a 
large dataset some of the sample keywords are corona 
covid covid covid and coronavirus it 
should be noted that although this ensures that we get a 
large chunk of covidrelated messages we still will 
miss some this approach resulted in  text messages

related to covid between march  and april   
the dates roughly correspond with the first wave of covid
 in pakistan
figure  gives a comparison of daily covidrelated 
and noncovidrelated messages in our dataset one 
can observe the irregularity in the percentage of images 
related to covid compared to the stable flow of text 
messages it was observed that rather than writing text mes
sages users found it more convenient to share images like 
news snippets and pictures from hospitals in fig  the 
vertical dotted line represents lockdown being imposed 
on the provincial level before the lockdown was officially 
imposed two spikes in percentage of images can be seen 
these spikes relate to people sharing news about a mass 
spread event observed near the capital city after the lock
down an awareness campaign was started by the govern
ment in which images that contained helpful info related to 
covid were shared users in our groups actively shared 
these informative images another interesting debate that 
occurred during this time was the rulings on offering prayers 
in mosques since pakistan is a muslim majority country 
many users shared sayings of scholars and news snippets 
related to this event as images it is interesting to know that 
wrt percentage  and in contrast to the trend seen for 
text messages  users were more inclined to share covid
related images than noncovid images see fig 
  
annotating covid images
twentyfive percent of the messages in our whatsapp data
set contained images we categorized images into covid
 and noncovidrelated images using manual 
annotators two annotators tagged a total of  images 
between march  and april   this resulted in  
noncovid images and  covid images the 
two annotators had an interannotator agreement score of 
 for the cases in which the annotators disagreed the 
annotators were allowed to discuss the case and give a final 
label unlike text annotation the annotators used a set of 
rules to identify the difference between covid images 
and noncovid images if any of the following rules 
applied to an image it was labeled as covid 
	 contained coronavirus covid or any other related 
terminology in urdu or english
	 contained information relating to a lockdown or any 
restrictions being imposedrelaxed by the government 
on business or publicprivate institutions
	 contained any precautionary measures like prayers for 
protection from disease herbal medications etc
	 contained any
