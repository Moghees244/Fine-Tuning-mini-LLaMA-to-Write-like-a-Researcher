it is anticipated that the world will have a shortage of  million healthcare
workers by  
of datadriven patientcentred clinical methods due to which
people are being assessed on population averages  to address
these challenges technologybased health can be utilised to
provide support to the healthcare system especially speech
processing has great potential to provide innovative solutions
in healthcare to facilitate both patients and doctors
broadly speaking human speech is the most natural mode of
human communication it provides information about linguis
tic content and paralinguistic states and traits the linguistic
content represents the intended message that the speaker wishes
to convey or communicate paralinguistics content of speech
provides a much rich array of information related to speakers
identity gender and age research efforts are exploring the
intelligent modelling of speech signals for various important
applications speech processing research is currently gaining
interest to utilise computational paralinguistic analysis for the
assessment of different health conditions the prime reason
to use speech for healthcare is that it can be easily available
collected transmitted and stored  most importantly various
physical and mental diseases cause changes in human speech
which are measurable with the help of speech technology
speech technology involving the processing and analysis
of human speech is a major area of research these days
it encompasses various areas of research such as automatic
speech recognition asr speaker recognitionveriﬁcation text
to speech tts conversion and identiﬁcation of language age
and gender using speech research on speech technology has
endeavoured to empower machines to involve in verbal human
machine interactions hci these days speech technology
based interfaces have become widely adopted worldwide in
various routinelyused devices and applications with services
such as apples siri and google voice search used by millions
of users  researchers are now aiming to transform the
current verbal hci interfaces into the next generation medical
companions that react with humans more naturally and monitor
users mental and physical health at their home work hospital
or anywhere in all these areas deep learning dl is emerging
as an essential component of stateoftheart approaches
recent progress in speech processing along with other ad
vanced technologies including the internet of things iot
and communications systems can ﬁx the current dysfunctional
healthcare system in particular recent breakthroughs in dl the
advent of iot and the advancement in communication systems
have opened up various promising opportunities for healthcare

ii primer on speech technology
speech technology aims to enable machines to recognise
analyse and understand human speech the area has been
developing for decades as a subﬁeld of signal processing and
has seen much progress in the last decade or so due to the huge
progress made under deep learning paradigms typically speech
technology systems include three major components as shown
fig 
major components of speech technology based systems
in fig  that include preprocessing feature extraction and
ml algorithms development
a preprocessing
preprocessing of speech signals is considered as an important
step in designing robust and efﬁcient systems for various appli
cations it usually involves noise suppression silence removal
and channel equalisation etc the performance of speechbased
systems can be improved with the use of these preprocessing
techniques   it has been also validated that removing
silence pauses and noise even helps mldl models in achieving
better performance  in the case of speech synthesis text
processing is even more complex it involves text normalisa
tion tokenisation sentence segmentation etc  it is equally
important in speech synthesis to improve system performance
b feature extraction
the representation of speech signals into meaningful in
formative and a reasonably limited number of features is a
crucial component for developing any system for speechbased
applications despite the fact that there is no unique taxonomy of
speech features it is common to divide features into two types
ie linguistic and acoustic features the extraction procedures
for these two types of features are signiﬁcantly different and
their performance greatly depends upon the type of problem at
hand
linguistic features represent information in spoken words
this usually includes speciﬁc words their grammatical alter
ations or higher semantic and pragmatic markers  a variety
of techniques exists for the analysis of speech using linguistic
features for example keyword spotting aims at the reliable
detection of a particular word in a given speech   these
words are chosen from daily life and considered sufﬁcient to
represent the speakers states and related events
acoustic features are very popular and widely being used
these features are primarily extracted using the models of the
human auditory system human hearingrelated properties such
as lower sensitivity at lower frequencies spectral amplitude
compression nonlinear frequency scale and large spectral inte
gration are also considered in acoustic features 
ongoing research on speech analysis has categorised the
acoustic features into three categories prosodic spectral and
temporal and features related to the voice quality  
prosody refers to melody and rhythm of speech and prosodic
features include the feature related to the length tone accent
stress intonation and few others   these features can
be used to detect the irregularities in the rhythm and timing
of speech for instance nonverbal speech cues such as inter
ruptions natural turns counting the number of interjections

table i
summary of some popular dl models
and response times can help to identify irregular speech pat
terns  in contrast to temporal features spectral features are
computed by converting the speech signal into the frequency
domain most popular temporal and spectral features include
energy  entropy  zerocrossing rate zcr  spec
tral centroid spectral rolloff and spectral ﬂux  similarly
voice qualityrelated features include jitter shimmer unvoiced
rate and harmonictonoise ratio hnr etc
recently the speech community also started using raw speech
instead of handengineered features for these features they
use dl models to extract datadriven features related to the
task at hand such features have shown promising results for
different speechrelated tasks including asr  emotion de
tection  and speaker identiﬁcation  however the per
formance of such methods needs to be explored and compared
with various handengineered features for healthrelated tasks
c deep learning
in speech technology the hidden markov model hmm and
gaussian mixture model gmm based models gmmhmm
have ruled for decades a disruptive breakthrough happened in
speech technology in the last decade due to dl and now dl
models have become an essential component of asr tts and
other speech processing and analysis tasks this section is aimed
to present an introductory and higherlevel overview of dl for
an indepth description the interested readers are referred to
classical resources  however we presented the summary
of different dl architecture in table i dl is distinguished from
legacy artiﬁcial neural networks anns in terms of having
two or more layers between input and output layers the basic
component of a deep neural network dnn is the neuron unit
the neurons in each layer are fully connected with the neurons
of the adjacent layers to create a network the input signal is
passed through the network with intermediate computation and
approximate function y  fx θ by learning the best value
of the parameters θ a multilayer network or dnn creates a
pipeline of nonlinear transformations with the ability to learn
intermediate representations suitable for a given task at hand
in  an idea of the learning hierarchy of feature rep
resentations in different layers of the deep learning models
was initiated by hinton  and models like deep belief net
works dbn  and stacked autoencoders sae  were
proposed these deep typologies take the advantages of un
supervised layerbylayer pretraining which is followed by
ﬁnetuning of the entire network using backpropagation these
models were widely utilised in speech technology and still being
considered for speech modelling  more recently research
in speech technology has been focused on endtoend learning
paradigms from raw speech using convolutional neural networks
cnns they can learn ﬁlterbank from raw speech and able to
capture more generalised discriminative and contextual repre
sentation from raw waveform 
convolutional neural networks cnns were originated
from image processing for processing data in gridlike topology
they are also extended for natural language processing nlp
and speech processing the building block of cnns is a con
volutional layer that consists of multiple ﬁlters and it computes
local feature maps from the input the convolutional operation
in cnns can be deﬁned as
hkij  wk q  bk
where hkij is the i jth element for the kth output feature
map q represents the input feature maps and wk and bk denote
the kth ﬁlter and bias respectively the symbol represents
the d convolution operation the second component of cnns
is the pooling layer to facilitates nonlinear subsampling oper
ations is to reduce the dimension of each feature maps while
retaining the most important features finally fully connected
layers are used to achieve the required prediction for regression
or classiﬁcation tasks in speech processing it is very common to
use cnn in conjunction with recurrent neural networks rnns
recurrent neural networks rnns deﬁne a special dl
architecture that uses recurrent connections within layers with
the capability of processing previously processed inputs in con
trast to hidden markov models hmms rnns have stronger
representational memory  and are better suited for mod
elling sequences structures like speech for an input sequence
xt  x    xt  at time step t rnns calculate the hidden
state ht by using the previous hidden state ht and produce a
output vector sequence yt  y    yt  the equations for
standard rnns are given below

where w terms denote the weight matrices b represents bias
vector and h deﬁnes the hidden layer function simple rnns
face vanishing gradient problem and fail to model the longterm
temporal contingencies to deal with this problem multiple
specialised rnn architectures were proposed these include
long shortterm memory lstm  and gated recurrent units
grus  with gating mechanism to add and forget the mem
ory selectively bidirectional rnns  were also proposed

by passing the input sequence through two different recurrent
hidden layers to enable both past and future modelling these
gated rnns solved the issue of the vanishing or exploding gradi
ent problems and can learn longterm contextual dependencies

technology  
generative models
including
variational autoencoders
vaes   generative adversarial networks gans
and autoregressive generative models   are being used
in speech technology gans are becoming very popular in
speech technology due to their ability to learn and generate data

iii speech for healthcare opportunities and
applications
the current healthcare system is struggling to provide quality
health services at an affordable price the effectiveness of health
services can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by using the opportunities
offered by speech technology  such opportunities are high
lighted in fig  and this section provide a detailed discussion
on these opportunities
a fixing speech and hearing impairments
humans express their feelings thoughts and ideas by speak
ing speech is produced by the action of coordinated muscles
in the head neck chest and abdomen the development of
speech is a gradual process that involves years of practice
during this process a human child learns how to regulate these
muscles to produce understandable speech individuals that are
unable to properly regulate these muscles face speech disorders
disorders related to voice and language also affect human com
munication  hearing problems are also a cause of imperfect
communications among humans individuals who do not hear
someone with normal hearing thresholds of  db or better in
both ears face hearing impairments according to the world
health organisation who over  of the worlds population
 million people has hearing loss and it is expected that this
number will increase up to  million people by  
speech technology can be utilised to assist individuals with
a hearing problem or a voice speech or language disorder to
communicate effectively  asr plays an important role in
the applications of speech therapy which require to decode the
user utterances  similarly speech synthesis provides can
teach users how a word or sentence should be pronounced which
reinforcing the correct pronunciation in the speech therapy ac
tivities in this way systems based on speech synthesis and asr
can be used to augment the quality of human communication in
healthcare   such assisting systems aim at improving
the intelligibility of pathologic speech by producing speech
similar to the voice of the speaker  speech technology
can also be used for design interfaces for childrens speech
therapy  dysarthria one of the major speech disorders that
arise as a secondary condition among individuals with cerebral
palsy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als stroke survivors

b speech interfaces for doctors and patients
speech interface describes an automated software that uses
either simulated human speech or human speech to interact
with humans they provide services in handsfree eyesfree
and keyboardfree situations with  of a healthcare profes
sionals time is spent on clinical documentation overwhelmed
clinicians often spend more time on clinical documentation
comparedtodirectpatientcareafactthatcandrainandde
motivate clinicians speech interfaces can provide a convenient
integration in healthcare to reduce the burden of medical doctors
the implementation of such interfaces can bring a lot of beneﬁts
to the healthcare industry from timesaving to costreducing
first of all practitioners and nurses will be able to become
more efﬁcient in the process of transcripts  secondly it will
increase productivity in healthcare systems  another beneﬁt
is that it will also reduce the amount of time by a doctor to see
the patients by using readily available information similarly
speech technology is a major mean of reducing the cost of
traditional medical transcription in healthcare systems more
than  of institutions were able to save more than  million
over the period of two or more years  voicebased assistants
can maintain patients electronic medical records emr and
provide relevant information when needed in a recent con
trolled observational study  participants found that speech
recognition in clinical documentation can saves time increases
efﬁciency and allows to make more detailed notes with relevant
details speech technologybased interfaces can help the patients
during their hospital stay and after discharge in particular
speech interfaces can facilitate patients recovering at home
especially when they have restricted mobility through support
for environment control such as adjusting a rooms temperature
controlling audio levels requesting nursing assistance and in
decision support  
c speech processing for psychological disorders
the term psychological disorder which refers to psychiatric
disorders or mental disorders are behavioural or psychological
symptoms or patterns which impact multiple areas of life
humans feel a vast range of comfortable and uncomfortable
emotions  and it has been argued that emotional discomfort
is a universal human experience  emotions are transient and
continually ﬂuctuating which may cause both positive and neg
ative effects on human life  on the other end psychological
disorders like stress depression anxiety suicidal behaviour and
distress which can lead to disabling conditions and impairment
in people distress is major emotional suffering and highly
prevalent in patients with a chronic disease like cancer 
despite the fact that psychological disorders can cause serious
consequences routine screening has not been widely adopted in
healthcare due to heavy cost and time requirements 
recent studies have shown the promise of using speech as an
effective biomarker for the diagnosis of psychological disorders
spoken speech can provide a wide range of acoustic features that
canbeeffectivelyutilisedforhumanemotiondetection
and diagnosis and monitoring of depression anxiety stress dis
tress and suicidal behaviour  stateoftheart deep learning
models have improved the performance of emotion recognition
depression anxiety stress distress and suicidal behaviour de
tection using speech   particularly the combination of
cnns and lstm has shown great performance in modelling
affective behaviours and related disorders from speech 
 here cnn is mainly used to extract temporal features
and contextual modelling is performed using lstm cnns are
also being employed in an endtoend fashion to extract features
from raw speech related to the problem at hand eg depression
detection  convolutional layer in cnns acts a datadriven
ﬁlterbank that can produce more generalised features compared
to the standard artiﬁcial neural networks anns and other
featurebased approaches  in this way deep learning models
are playing an important role in modelling as well as diagnosis
of different psychological disorder using speech signal this
demonstrates that the speech technology has great potentials to
automate the screening and monitoring of mental illnesses and
related disorders hence alleviating many healthcare challenges
d home and elder care
life expectancy is greatly increasing worldwide which is
causing a higher number of older people in our society 
the increased share of the elderly population is shifting the
cause of death from parasitic and infectious diseases to chronic

comparison of recent studies on asr
illnesses   ageing also causes physical limitations that
need to be compensated by the assistance of someone or with the
services of aged care centres elderly people feel isolation fear
and a sense of helplessness both inhome and at oldage care
centres which cause severe consequences on both physical and
mental health speechbased assistants are a valuable tool for
seniors staying at home or age care centres especially for those
who are not able to use other technologybased services that may
require the dexterity of the hands mobility andor good vision
such systems can also provide them with independence and a
better quality of life with physical or cognitive disease 
e access to healthcare services particularly in
developing countries
millions of people in developing countries unnecessarily suf
fer and eventually die from such illnesses that have effective cure
and prevention  generally people in developing countries
havepoorliteracyskillsiereadingwritingithasbeenshown
that people with low health literacy have a oneinthree chance
of misunderstanding the prescribed medication  there is
a direct correlation between mortality rates and poor health
literacy approximately  to  increased mortality risk for
individuals with poor health literacy  language diversity
is another challenge in developing countries that reduces the
potential beneﬁts of healthcare services such as text messaging
and ehealth portals  such healthcare services are also not
much useful for lowliterates the blind the visually impaired
and those that are not computer literate speech is a plausi
ble interaction modality for illiterate users and speechbased
healthcare services can be ideal for inhabitants of the developing
countries
iv speech for healthcare stateoftheart
a automatic speechrecognition asr
automatic speech recognition asr is the analogue of
machine ear which enables a computer to recognise uttered
speech and transform it into the corresponding sequence of
words or subwords asr has witnessed a steady improvement
in performance due to the development of cuttingedge ml
algorithms traditionally hmm and gmm based models were
the main stock of research for asr dnnbased asr systems
have become the stateoftheart by showing huge improvements
compared to previous conventional system  developing and
training asr systems however is complicated and requires
a lot of preprocessing various attempts have been made to
reduce the complexity of asr paving the way for endtoend
speech recognition  nowadays endtoend asr systems
are extensively used and studied for asr in different languages
such as english mandarin japanese or french  similarly
sequencetosequence models are also gaining popularity in
the automatic speech recognition asr community  vari
ous sequencetosequence models including recurrent neural
network transducer rnnt  neural transducer 
listen attend and spell las  recurrent neural aligner
rnaandmonotonicalignmentshavebeenexplored
in the literature in addition transformers  based models are
also gaining success in asr ﬁeld due to their better perfor
mance we presented the performance comparison of different
stateoftheart models in terms of worderrorrate wer in
table ii these systems demonstrate promising results on dif
ferent datasets which shows the feasibility of their integration
into healthcare applications
a major application of asr in healthcare is to facilitate
the generation of clinical documentations  the medical
errors caused by bad handwriting can be avoided using speech
recognition for medical documentations  such selftyping
systems are also believed to enhance documentation quality and
efﬁciency as well as improve the satisfaction level of health
professionals in clinics or hospitals 
different research studies explored the feasibility of asr sys
tems for clinical documentation for instance in  authors
evaluated a webbased asr system in a university hospital for
clinical documentation in the german language they found that
medical documentation with asr increases in documentation
speed and amount and it also has a positive impact on participant
mood in contrast to selftyping hodgson et al  explored
the use of asr for medical transcription of the doctorpatient
conversation they used   hours of speech and demon
strated that the proposed models achieved promising results
on important medical utterances and therefore can be used
practically in a clinical setting for transcribing medical conversa
tions in  authors performed a case study in a specialised
outpatient department and found that asr software supports
medical doctors by quickly producing patient discharge letters
without impairing user satisfaction
the efﬁciency of speech recognition is evaluated by hoyt
et al  for documenting outpatient encounters in the ehr
system at a military hospital and its  outlying clinics seventy
ﬁve clinicians participated to evaluate speech recognition for
clinical documentation among these participants  of the
clinicians continued to use speech recognition in their rou
tine practices and reported that speech recognition for clinical
authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april  at  utc from ieee xplore  restrictions apply 
ieee reviews in biomedical engineering vol  
documentation is more convenient accurate and expeditious
for instance speech recognition helped in improving note qual
ity and allowed for closing a patient encounter on the same
day similarly authors in  showed that medical speech
recognition can perform on a par with humans authors in 
developed a webbased prototype to generate medical reports in
the brazilian portuguese language using google web speech
api and microsoft bing speech api they found that a system
based on google api achieved an error rate of  which
wassigniﬁcantlybetterthanthoseachievedbythemicrosoftapi
 few other studies  also highlighted the potential
of using asr for clinical documentation
all of these studies highlight several beneﬁts of using asr
for clinical documentation however most of these studies are
pilot projects although the use of asr can drive interactive
clinical documentation however careful evaluation is required
for ehr  there is still a need to improve the efﬁciency
of asr for medical documentation to avoid errors that have the
potential to cause clinical harms furthermore improved system
interoperability and workﬂow are needed for their successful
integration in the clinical setting 
b speech biomarkers
human voice incorporates features that can plausibly be
used to discriminate on the basis of gender age intelligence
socioeconomic status regionalethnic origin education and
occupation  most importantly for health outcomes it
provides information about various voice disorders which can
be diagnosed by detecting anomalous voice quality pitch and
loudness that is inappropriate for an individuals age gender
cultural background or geographic location  other speech
related disorders include cognitivecommunication disorders
communication disorders swallowing disorders and an autism
spectrum disorder speech technologybased solutions have
been playing an important role in the diagnostic and monitoring
of these disorders nowadays dl models have become the
stateoftheart technique in this domain
automatic detection of vocal fold pathologies is of great
interest to the voice community as well as the medical commu
nity due to its low cost and noninvasive nature these systems
can be used by clinicians to detect the existence of any voice
pathologies even in the early stages fang et al  retrospec
tively collected normal pathological voice samples of  common
clinical voice disorders and evaluated both ml models and
dnns they found that dnns outperformed other ml models
including svm and gmms authors in  used convolutional
dbn for voice pathology and showed that cnn can effec
tively extract features from spectrograms of voice recordings
suitable for diagnosing of voice disorders harar et al 
conducted a preliminary study on voice pathology using dnns
and showed that the use of combined cnnlstm provides
promising results in  the authors investigated a voice
pathology detection system using dl on a mobile multimedia
healthcare system and voices samples captured using mobile
devices more speciﬁcally the authors used a cnn architecture
and reported signiﬁcantly improved results in other work some
researchers   designed voice pathology detection
systems for smart cities but their work used classical ml models
in their architectures
acoustic analysis of speech is also used for the diagnosis
of alzheimers disease which is cognitive impairment and the
most common cause of dementia it has a high prevalence that
is increasing rapidly towards an epidemic level the research
community is trying to utilise speech technology to solve this
issue in  lopezdeipina et al proposed a nonlinear
multitask approach using a multilayer perceptron mlp and
cnns for alzheimers detection the authors evaluated the
proposed models using different speech features and reported
promising results in  fraser et al explored the use of
linguistic features for the identiﬁcation of alzheimers they
achieved stateoftheart results and found that linguistic analy
sis using modern ml is increasingly useful in assessment and
clustering of alzheimers
speech analysis is also being utilised for parkinsons disease
pd detection for instance authors in  designed to diag
nosis pd using speech signal they used dbns for classiﬁcation
and achieved signiﬁcantly improved results attesting the power
of dbn for speech analysis frid et al  used raw speech
for pd detection using cnns they found that relatively small
 ms of raw speech contains much information regarding the
pd that can be used for classiﬁcation speech technology is
also being used for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
asd in children different studies used dl and speech signals
for asd detection   also to assist children with
asd 
human speech provides a wide range of prosodic and spectral
features that can be effectively utilised for emotion recognition
depression distress anxiety and stress detection acoustic fea
tures including spectral prosodic cepstral glottal and teager
energy operators teo were evaluated in for clinical depres
sion detection in adolescents  authors found that teo
based features produced more promising results compared to
all other features in  the authors showed that the prosody
and voice qualityrelated speech features can be used for the
identiﬁcation of suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents in 
behaviour prediction of cancerafﬂicted patients is performed
using different speech features they showed that speech can
effectively be utilised for behavioural prediction in cancer pa
tients various other studies  utilised speech feature
for identiﬁcation stress anxiety and depression in english and
also in other languages
most of the abovementioned studies have used publicly
available datasets and showed that speech technology can be
effectively utilised as biomarkers for the detection of various
diseases however these systems have not been evaluated in
reallife settings it is important for researchers to focus on the
design of systems that can be utilised in clinics and medical
hospitals and on reporting reallife performance evaluations
c remote monitoring
the rising burden on the global healthcare system along
with the limited availability of trained healthcare profession
als is increasing the demand for infrastructure and technology
that can facilitate the remote monitoring of patients speech
authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april  at  utc from ieee xplore  restrictions apply 
latif et al speech technology for healthcare opportunities challenges and state of the art
technologybased remote monitoring services have been ex
plored in this regard by the research community in 
hossain used speech along with and facial expressions which
are captured in a multisensory environment the author tested
the proposed framework on  people and was able to detect
the patients state with an average recognition of  in
another work vatanparvar et al  designed a speech privacy
preservation method for speechbased remote health monitoring
using gan and reported promising results a remote system for
monitoring of speechlanguage intervention is proposed in 
for the parents of children with asd for remote monitoring and
assessment of cognitive function in senior people a system was
proposed by rapcan et al in  the authors used telephone
speech recordings and showed that the system can achieve
similar results compared to speech recorded in a controlled
environment the sweethome project was proposed in 
which used noiserobust multisource asr to detect distressed
sentences in a realistic environment of a smart home to monitor
distress situations
various studies also have proposed speech remote monitoring
systems by exploiting the advanced communication technolo
gies a g enabled emotionaware healthcare framework was
proposed in  the authors evaluated the proposed health
care framework on  universitylevel students who were asked
to express the emotion of pain they used both speech and video
as the input of the system and achieved  of accuracy
a privacyenhanced emotion recognition system for remote
advisory is presented in  the authors showed that the pro
posed system can solve privacy issues while achieving promis
ing results similarly an edgecloud based privacypreserving
automatic emotion recognition system is proposed which use
both speech and visual features  they used cnns for
emotion classiﬁcation and achieved improved results compared
to the stateoftheart systems some other studies 
have also used speech signal for remote patients monitoring
however most of these studies evaluated the proposed models
in a controlled setup therefore to ensure a safe and robust
operation it is very important to evaluate these systems in
reallife settings
d speech synthesis
speech synthesis also known as texttospeech tts is an
important technology that aims to convert text into speech
most of the tts systems use acoustic or linguistic features
as an intermediate representation to generate the waveform
traditionally the speech waveform was vocoded from these in
termediate representation using heuristic methods  or using
handcrafted vocoders   recently tacotron  
used wavenet  as a vocoder to generate waveform from
melspectrograms wavenet is an autoregressive generative
model that can generate relatively realistic humanlike speech
by using linguistic features it has the downside of a long infer
ence time due to its autoregressive architecture to address this
issue various models such as fftnet  wavernn 
and waveglow  have been proposed nowadays these
neural vocoders have replaced the use of traditional heuristic
methods and can dramatically enhance the quality of generated

etc patients can be verbally reminded about important alerts
using tts which increases the usability and accessibility of
portable health trackers  different studies evaluated the
feasibility of tts assistive healthcare system for instance
liu et al  designed a smartphonebased system to help
visually impaired people while using android phones in 
the authors presented a design of a ttsbased interactive med
ication reminder and tracking system for wrist devices they
evaluated the system for both native and nonnative english
speakers in controlled experiments and achieved very promising
results a voice interactive assistant was designed in  to
improve adherence to medical treatments the authors designed
this system for stroke patients and tested among several healthy
subjects for an initial assessment however the ﬁnal product
was reported to be still under development
tts health assistive tools can dramatically improve people
health and required costs for example a ttsbased system can
facilitate patients by offering them an audio version of digital
text   this is especially helpful for illiterate individ
uals language learners and the elderly population and people
with learning disabilities or reduced vision such systems can

ical information such as descriptions of diseases prescriptions
and drug information leaﬂets this avoids drug misuse while
making patients cautious about their health  ttsbased
systems also allow patients to accurately communicate their
needs which helps to establish a cognitive connection among
doctors and patients

challenges of deep learning dl empowered speech processing in healthcare
these solutions are being used by both doctors and patients to
change the traditional setting of health provision the devel
opment of speechbased solutions is continuously growing that
will signiﬁcantly impact the current healthcare system in the
next several years
v speech for healthcare challenges
despite the promising potentials of speech technology in the
health domain there are various hurdles in largescale deploy
ment of speechenabled solutions in this section we discuss
these challenges that need to be addressed to make the rapid
adoption of speech technology in healthcare a taxonomy is
depicted in fig 
a speech based adversarial attacks
even though modern dlbased speech solutions offer great
beneﬁts to the current healthcare system there are still questions
about the security of the underlying dl algorithms as recent
works have shown that dl models are prone to adversarial
attacks adversarial attacks are launched by creating adversar
ial examples in which nonrandom imperceptible perturbations
are added to input samples through optimization algorithms that
aim to fool the classiﬁer and inﬂuence it to make incorrect
decisions these attacks are powerful enough to signiﬁcantly
bring down the performance of the stateoftheart dnn based
systems  a popular method for generating such adversarial
attacks is to generate the perturbation by utilizing gradient
based methodsmany popular attacks such as fast gradient
sign method fgsm  jacobianbased saliency map at
tack jsma  deepfool  and carlini and wagner
attacks  follow this method many more sophisticated
attacks also exist including those that rely on nongradient based
methods 
researchers have also proposed various adversarial attacks
against speechbased systems for example carlini and wag
ner  evaluated an iterative optimisationbased adversarial
attack against deepspeech  a stateoftheart asr model
with  success rate some other popular adversarial attacks
against speechbased systems include  the success
of these adversarial attacks highlights the vulnerability of speech

latif et al speech technology for healthcare opportunities challenges and state of the art
technology to for healthcare therefore it is necessary to design
such systems that preserve patients privacy in the healthcare
settings
b scarcity of speech data
to achieve generalisation in dl models a large amount of
data is essential in the case of speech processing and analysis
the available datasets are typically very limited  even for
a very developed ﬁeld of asr we have transcribed datasets
for very few languages compared to the number of spoken lan
guages worldwide there are more than   spoken languages
globally however only  languages are spoken by  of
the worlds population in speech processing we do not even
have speech datasets for  languages   therefore
research in language and speech analysis research is facing
the problem of data scarcity  this imbalance variation
diversity and dynamics in speech and languages cause hurdles
in designing speechbased healthcare systems for example the
performance of asr systems degrades when they are evaluated
across different languages  therefore we need to design
more adaptive healthcare solutions using asr trained on multi
ple languages data the datasets related to speech disorders are
also very few and have very small sizes   to solve this
issue techniques such as transfer learning selftaught learning
etc can be utilised to improve the generalisability of the models
c interoperability challenges
in current healthcare systems the data generated from differ
ent medical devices clinical reports medical correspondence
electronic health records ehrs these medical data are typ
ically fragmented or isolated within hospitals and laborato
ries the interoperability of these medical records is prohibited
among different health services providers  on the contrary
different ehrs medical devices and other it systems are also
not interoperable if data sharing is allowed among different hos
pitals  for the effective utilisation of speech in healthcare
we need to enable interoperability in current healthcare sys
tems this would boost the speed of diagnostic procedures and
provide a complete history of patients to medical practitioners
therefore the attention of researchers and other stakeholders
working in the healthcare sector is required to ﬁnd solutions for
interoperability challenges
d cultural and language barriers
cultural and language diversity reduces the potential use of
speech technology in digital healthcare digital health is not only
a technological but cultural transformation cultural barrier is a
major challenge for digital transformation which becomes more
prevalent in rural and developing areas the transformation of
people from the classical method to digital health is slowed down
by ignoring the importance of cultural changes and the human
factors  therefore it is important to consider cultural
barriers while designing healthcare solutions in addition to
cultural barriers language diversity problem is another major
online available httpswwwethnologuecomstatistics
problemitisfoundthatthelinguisticdifferencesamongpatients
and medical doctors can cause patients to misinterpret med
ications and suffer unnecessary complications  therefore
healthcare solutions based speech technology must be trained on
multiple languages to work effectively in such situations how
ever the development of speech technologybased healthcare
systems becomes more challenging for rarely spoken languages
therefore it is very important to consider language diversity
while designing speechbased healthcare solutions
vi open issues and future directions
speech technology is expected to drive the change in the
healthcare system by changing the conventional ways of medical
treatments however there are some open issues that require
serious attention and consideration of the researchers there
fore in this section we highlighted such open issues and with
important pointers and future research directions for the research
community
a privacy and ethical concerns
when people use speechbased services such as speech recog
nition or voice authentication they provide complete possession
to their voice recordings to the respective device or software in
these services speech can be used by an adversary or attacker
to extract users information such as speakers identity gender
ethnicity information and emotional state the adversary can
use this information for undesired purposes such as to fool
voiceauthentication systems similarly users speech can also
be edited or used to create a fake speech that the person never
spoke several other privacyrelated concerns arise while using
speech technologybased services  in healthcare systems
information is more personal and very sensitive and people
are more vulnerable to the misuse of their data therefore
it is important to utilise speech processing in healthcare by
considering both privacy and ethical concerns in this regard
privacypreserving dl algorithms can be utilised to protect
speaker identity   gender identity  similarly
federated learning  is another alternative solution to pre
serve users privacy in federated learning training data remains
decentralised using multiple participating devices
b adoptability and affordability issues
speechbased digital healthcare solutions are intended to be
used by all types of users including people with no literacy or
education about smart devices usability of healthcare solutions
effects adoption of various innovative digital healthcare products
orservicesthereforeitiscrucialfordeveloperstoconsider
these issues while designing hci interface for speech based
healthcare solutions it is also important to provide speech
technologybased services at an affordable cost as it directly
impacts on the adaptability of these solutions 
c iot based solutions
the paradigm of internet of things iot offers unprece
dented opportunities for digital healthcare solutions by provid
ing an abstraction of inﬁnite physical smart and virtual objects
authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april  at  utc from ieee xplore  restrictions apply 
ieee reviews in biomedical engineering vol  
these objects can capture store and securely transmit health
related information to a public or private cloud and facilitate
a new level of automation for the convenience of users most
importantly iotbased solutions are very effective in terms
of energy consumption cpu and memory usage  it is
anticipated that iot will disrupt the current healthcare systems
by providing various cuttingedge and highly individualised
digital healthcare solutions  these solutions can be utilised
for remote monitoring and diagnostics chronic diseases man
agement elderly care and much more therefore it is very
important to utilise the opportunities offered by iot to enhance
the effectiveness of speechbased healthcare services
d potentials with g
healthcare expenditure takes a big portion of the national
budgets of various countries for instance roughly  of
north americas and  of the global economys gross do
mestic product gdp account for healthcare spending 
technologyenabled healthcare solutions can provide health
services outside the hospital setting at remote locations which
can promote adherence to medications and reduce cost and
readmission rates  telehealth services by utilising g lte
have shown sound economic beneﬁts  which will be
further fuelled by the increasing amount of smartphones and
expeditiously improving connectivity with g network it is
anticipated that g will provide a consistent user experience not
only in dense areas but also in remote locations this will pave
the path for telehealth services available everywhere therefore
it is important for researchers working on speech processing for
health to consider the opportunities offered by communication
technologies while designing healthcare solutions
e sustainability issues
speech technologybased healthcare solutions have great po
tentials in healthcare and they are getting great interest and
attention among industries and healthcare service providers
however it is important to understand how any particular speech
technologybased healthcare solution can attain a certain level
of adoption to achieve scale the sustainability of any new
digital health solutions is always considered uncertain as they
involve different various public and private stakeholders 
the sustainability of such projects and products become more
uncertain in developing countries where people avoid to use
digital technology therefore a proper collaboration is always
needed among stakeholders to support the project to make a
transitionfrompilotstagetoaselfsustainablelongtermproject
vii conclusion
speech technology has unprecedented opportunities for the
health domain and these potential opportunities can be reaped
to ﬁx the current healthcare system that is continuously facing an
increasing burden of the ageing population and chronic diseases
in this paper we highlighted the potentials of speech technology
for healthcare and presented a stateoftheart work on health
care from different speechrelated including automatic speech
recognition asr speech synthesis and speech processing
for different speechrelated disorders the reviewed literature
showed that the research on speech processing for healthcare is
rapidly evolving with very promising results however these
results are mainly from some pilot projects or using some
publicly available datasets and the available healthcare solutions
based on speech technology are being used on a very small
scale there are various factors hindering the growth of speech
technology in healthcare that we discussed in detail in this paper
most importantly we presented open issues and based on that
we outlined future strategies for making speech technologies
even more effective in healthcare which include the utilisation
of other emerging technologies like internet of things iot and
communication technologies like g
